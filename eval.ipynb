      "1: A 58-year-old man with a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis presented to the emergency room with right flank pain, dysuria, and subjective fever. He reported having had occasional hematuria over the past few years. Three weeks prior to this presentation, he was admitted for renal colic and was found to have a new staghorn calculus in his kidney (Figure ). He was treated with antibiotics for seven days.\\nThe patient had several episodes of renal colic secondary to nephrolithiasis that were treated with lithotripsy several years ago. His social history is significant for a 30-pack year history of smoking and occasional alcohol use without any substance abuse or high-risk behavior. The patient also reported having lost 40 pounds over the past three months as well as drenching night sweats and low-grade fevers.\\nAt the time of presentation, his blood pressure was 78/49 mmHg (mean arterial pressure [MAP] = 59 mmHg) which was new compared to his recent admission three weeks prior where blood pressure readings were consistently above a MAP of 80. This hypotension did not correct with a bolus of 3 liters of normal saline.\\nThe patient’s initial laboratory values are shown in Table .\\nBased on his history of dysuria, intermittent hematuria, and recent diagnosis of staghorn calculus he was diagnosed with urinary tract infection leading to urosepsis and septic shock.\\nHe was admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) where pressor support with norepinephrine along with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (vancomycin + piperacillin/tazobactam) were initiated promptly.\\nOn presentation temperature measured by bladder thermistor was noted at be at 97.3°F; heart rate -80 beats per minute; respiratory rate -18 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation -98% -99% on room air\\nOn general exam he appeared an average sized man in mild distress who looked like someone who has been through major stressful event such as being critically ill recently but otherwise seemed well developed without any obvious icterus or cyanosis or jaundice etc., He appeared cachectic from chronic illnesses but overall vitals signs were stable except for hypotension mentioned above\\nHeart sounds showed regular rate & rhythm without any murmurs gallops rubs etc.; Lungs were clear bilaterally on auscultation; Abdomen revealed no masses no organomegaly liver & spleen could not be felt below costal margins due to body habitus but otherwise no masses etc.; Extremities revealed no edema clubbing or cyanosis etc.; Neurological examination including mental status examination revealed normal speech volume tone & strength throughout all extremities cranial nerves grossly intact reflexes present sensations grossly intact gait ambulates without assistance\\nInitial work up included urinalysis which showed RBC >50/hpf WBC >50/hpf bacteria >25/hpf moderate calcium oxalate crystals moderate epithelial cells specimen sent for culture came back negative after two days however patient improved clinically while receiving empirical treatment started on vancomycin + piperacillin tazobactam once culture results available antibiotics deescalated based on culture sensitivities after discussion at infectious disease rounds Patient received one dose Nafcillin also based on infectious disease recommendations given clinical picture acute kidney injury worsening uremia metabolic acidosis hyperphosphatemia hyperparathyroidism all consistent chronic kidney disease stage G3A1 severe sepsis secondary urinary tract infection blood cultures drawn multiple times during hospitalization showed gram positive cocci gram stain performed earlier suggested gram positive cocci possible staphylococcus epidermidis repeat cultures drawn later grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis again however these blood cultures never grew more than one type only once so it wasn’t considered true bacteremia by infectious disease specialist consultant service therefore it wasn’t considered relevant here despite what textbooks say about needing three separate occasions see same organism grow from blood draws done at different times during same episode if it is true bacteremia that is being discussed here although this has been debated among experts elsewhere anyway endocrine workup done due to high parathyroid hormone levels seen initially resulted in finding out that he had primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma seen on neck ultrasound followed by parathyroid scan later\n",

      "1: Case\n",
      "A 29-year-old male was brought to the Emergency Centre of Bloemfontein Memorial Hospital after a motor vehicle accident. His car had been involved in a head-on collision with a water tanker, with the wheel of the latter rolling over his lower body. The patient was extricated from the wreckage and brought to hospital in a conscious state. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15; he had a pulse rate of 80 beats/minute and blood pressure (BP) of 90/60 mmHg. There was significant bleeding due to a perineum injury. The patient had no sensory or motor deficit of the lower extremities and no hematuria or difficulty with urinary catheterization. He underwent initial management, including fluid replacement and blood transfusion, and was taken to the operating theatre for injury assessment 4 hours after admission.\n",
      "2. Postoperative care\n",
      "The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, during which it was found that he had sustained a complete disruption of the posterior pelvic floor with lateral extensions into both gluteal regions and the right thigh (). The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and urethra were intact. Multiple packs were inserted to stop an extensive venous bleeding caused by avulsion of the pelvic plexus. A small incision (7 cm) was made to perform defunctioning sigmoid colostomy through an opening in the lumen of colon rather than creating an abdominal wall opening as is usually done in damage control surgery (). This small incision helped reduce intra-abdominal pressure and prevent its deleterious effects on organ function []. Other injuries were treated conservatively because they were not considered life threatening during preoperative assessment.\\nThe packs were removed without any bleeding complications 4 days later, at which time it became evident that there was significant ongoing oozing from soft tissues surrounding rectum without any further hemorrhage from previously damaged sites. A second operation centre around damage control principles [–] included insertion of two more packs, reduction of the size of skin incision by reapproximating incised edges together () followed by wound vac application () [–]. We have used this technique successfully in multiple trauma patients who are at risk for high volume leakage from damaged bowel when abdominal closure is performed too early.\\nThe patient required a total of 22 units of blood during first 48 hours post trauma after which point hemoglobin concentration remained stable without requiring further blood transfusion.\\n3.. Follow up examination\n",
      "Following initial stabilization procedure coupled with supportive treatment, we decided to manage our patient conservatively based on X-ray evidence indicating contrast extravasation from his rectum (); this decision took into account our patient’s young age and his lackof comorbidities.\\nAfter consultation with our radiologist we decided against using embolization technique as it would have required inserting arterial lines – which would have posed additional risk due to ongoing coagulopathy – thus making such procedure technically impossible.\\nWe opted instead for regular enemas along with parenteral administrationof broad spectrum antibiotics; these measures ledto progressive improvementin our patient’s clinical state until full recoverywas achievedafter approximately three months<EOD> .\n",

      "1: A 28-year-old male with no history of infectious diseases, diabetes, or any immunocompromising condition presented to our hospital in April 2018 with a 3-year history of recurrent ear discomfort and discharge from his right ear. The patient had a history of seawater contact; he went diving near the coast of the Yellow Sea near Qingdao City in Shandong Province in August 2015. After a couple of days, the patient noticed discharge from both ears; however, only the right ear exhibited persistent symptoms. Initially, clear fluid was observed from both ears; however, this soon turned into thick purulent exudate that was dark brown or chocolate colored (Figure ). The left ear gradually vanished within half a month after debris removal using cotton swabs; hearing returned to normal and symptoms were relieved. However, new thick drainage would obstruct his ear canal and symptoms would reappear within days. The underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve despite twice seeking health care at local hospitals in Xi’an City from Shaanxi Province.\\nThe discharge gradually reduced and turned from brown to white until March 2018 when low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution (approximately pH = 7) was used to rinse his right ear canal at a local hospital for another episode of otitis externa. No other clinical manifestations were observed during this period except for mild hearing loss coupled with intermittent tinnitus as well as sensation of fullness in his ears.\\nThe patient denied fever, chills, headache vertigo diarrhea flatulence or other relevant medical history such as trauma surgery or blood transfusion before disease onset.\\nBefore diagnosis audiometric otoscopic examinations were performed along with radiological examinations using computed tomography imaging to examine temporal bone structure correct positioning placement and level of ventilation tubes if necessary laboratory tests including hemogram erythrocyte sedimentation rate C-reactive protein total lymphocyte count CD3+ T lymphocytes CD4+ T lymphocytes CD8+ T lymphocytes CD4/CD8 ratio IgG IgA IgM complement C3 complement C4 tumor biomarkers carcinoembryonic antigen alpha fetoprotein cancer antigen CA795 CA1992 sialyl Tn antigen carbohydrate antigen CA125 carbohydrate antigen CA153 prostate specific antigen neuron specific enolase ferritin thyroid microsomal autoantibody thyroglobulin autoantibody thyroid peroxidase autoantibody rheumatoid factor anti nuclear cytoplasmic autoantibodies anti nuclear membrane autoantibodies immune complexes urine microprotein electrophoresis immunoglobulin free light chain beta-D glucan galactomannan plasma HIV Ab syphilis Ab tuberculosis related proteins urine red blood cell count urine occult blood test fecal routine test stool occult blood test abdominal B ultrasound cardiac color Doppler ultrasound electrocardiogram pulmonary function tests arterial blood gas analysis pulmonary ventilation function lung volume measurement system respiratory impedance measurement system serum lactate dehydrogenase serum uric acid serum creatinine serum potassium ion sodium ion chloride ion carbon dioxide combining power total protein albumin globulin alkaline phosphatase aspartate amino transferase alanine amino transferase gamma glutamyl transpeptidase creatine kinase isozyme MB creatine kinase isozyme MB mass spectrometry liver biochemical index high sensitivity C reactive protein coagulation function\\nAfter admission otoscopic examination revealed that both external auditory canals had no debris but exhibited different degrees of edema erythema hyperemia especially on the right side where there was also hypertrophic scarring (Figure ).

      "1: Case description\n",
      "The patient was a 60-year-old woman. She had been trained as a healthcare assistant and had grown up in a coastal area in a small town. She was married and had two adult children with whom she had no contact.\n",
      "She gradually increased her alcohol consumption over the years, and although she was in contact with outpatient services for alcohol dependence, her drinking continued to increase. After losing her job, she became socially isolated. She was visited by home nurses several times per day, who often found her in severe withdrawal, sometimes convulsing. She was underweight and incontinent; her apartment was untidy and rarely cleaned, smelled of urine and feces, and showed her lack of personal hygiene; she also appeared depressed and talked about suicide.\\nAfter moving into the nursing home about 18 months after losing her job (time point t0), she became stable enough to be able to manage personal hygiene with minimal assistance (help once daily). Although she still drank heavily on most days (and occasionally drank heavily for 1–2 weeks), at this time point (t1) she did not cause problems with other residents or staff because of intoxication or withdrawal symptoms; rather, she started to eat at meals and began to look better than before. However, despite being resident in the nursing home from t0–t1 for only 3 months (see Figure ), during which time there were no recorded hospitalizations or ER visits related to AUDs or their consequences such as injuries from falls due to intoxication or withdrawal symptoms), it is likely that these problems were present but that they were managed within the nursing home.\\nDuring the 18 months before moving into the nursing home (t0), our patient had been hospitalized nine times for periods ranging from 1 to 19 days; see Figure ) for periods when our patient's total cost of care included both specialized somatic care at hospitals as well as primary care provided by general practitioners at clinics outside hospitals) for periods when our patient's total cost of care included both specialized somatic care at hospitals as well as primary care provided by general practitioners at clinics outside hospitals)for periods when our patient's total cost of care included both specialized somatic care at hospitals as well as primary care provided by general practitioners at clinics outside hospitals)\\nDuring this period before moving into the nursing home:\n",
      "She spent approximately one-third of this time receiving specialized somatic acute hospital treatment mainly due to severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms requiring benzodiazepines intravenously; see Table ) shows details regarding all admissions).\\nIn addition, during this period before moving into the nursing home:\n",
      "She made one outpatient visit where an internist treated hepatic encephalopathy.\\nShe made several ER visits related primarily but not exclusively due to severe alcohol withdrawal.\\nThe total cost associated with all contacts between this woman’s healthcare system use related directly/indirectly/not related all during these 18 months prior t0 amounted DKK 475 743 (= approximately EUR56 922=); see Table ).\\nFrom t0–t1 until death (approximately another year), our case used very little acute hospital treatment except on two occasions when admitted on an acute medical ward due primarily not directly/not indirectly/not known whether indirectly related AUDs complications such as severe withdrawal symptoms requiring benzodiazepines intravenously); see Table ).\\nHowever—despite being resident in the same facility—our case did not have any contacts shared with Case I., although they died only three months apart.\\nOur case used no outpatient services after having moved into the facility except on one occasion where an internist treated hepatic encephalopathy.\\nOur case made fewer ER visits than during any previous period since we have records available—fewer than six per year on average compared with more than ten per year previously—but nonetheless still made more than ten visits annually throughout most years since we have records available including eight visits annually during last year alive;\\nt3;\\nt4;\\nt5;\\nt6;\\nt7;\\nt8;\\nt9:\\nduring last year alive). The reason why there are so few ER visits is unknown but may be explained by fewer opportunities given that it is less likely that heavy drinking episodes would go undetected within their living unit compared with if they lived alone like Case I.; however,\\nthis does not explain why there are so few emergency room contacts overall given that it seems unlikely that emergency room contacts would decrease simply because someone moves onto an assisted living ward within a facility? One possibility could be if people who move onto assisted living wards become too ill themselves? This does not seem plausible though based upon how long people live after moving onto assisted living wards? Another possibility could be if people who move onto assisted living wards become less mobile thereby reducing their chances of accidents? Again though mobility does not seem like it would explain reductions seen here unless mobility decreases dramatically which seems unlikely given how long people live after moving onto assisted living wards?? Another explanation could be if family members reduce their own use following bereavement? Again though bereavement effects do not seem like they would explain reductions seen here unless family members reduced their own use dramatically which again seems implausible?? Finally another explanation could be if family members reduce demands placed upon staff regarding help seeking behavior following bereavement??? This seems plausible??? Indeed families can exert considerable influence over service utilization []. Thus while we cannot say definitively why fewer emergency room contacts occurred among Case II relative those among Case I., one possible explanation might lie within changes occurringspecifically\n",

      "1: A 36-year-old mother, with a total of 5 pregnancies and 1 live birth, gave birth to a healthy boy via cesarean section at week 37. She had a history of artificial abortion twice and spontaneous abortion once. The family history was unremarkable. Ultrasound test result was normal at gestational week (GW) 6. At GW12, nuchal translucency of 1.3 mm was observed with no positive findings; Non-invasive DNA analysis showed low trisomy 21 risk, low trisomy 18 risk and low trisomy 13 risk.\\nUltrasound examination at GW24+5 showed abnormal development of the long bones of the limbs: the length of long bones were shorter than that controlled to the same gestational week in normal fetus (Figs. , ). The length from femoral epiphysis to metaphysis in short axis view was shorter than that in normal fetus by more than three times (Figs. , ). Thick metaphysis could be seen in right lower limb ultrasonography (Figs., ), irregular vertebral arrangement could be seen in thoracic vertebrae ultrasonography (Figs., ) and narrow and small thorax could be seen on transverse section ultrasonography (Figs., ).

The mother received regular prenatal care, including prenatal vitamins and iron during pregnancy and also received Stadol for pain relief during labor. Toward the end of her pregnancy, the mother developed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The mother was hepatitis B negative, HIV negative, and Group B Streptococcus negative; however rubella and VDRL were unknown. The patient was born by vaginal delivery with spontaneous rupture of membranes approximately 2 hours prior to delivery. Apgars were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Vitamin K and Erythromycin eye ointment were given in the delivery room. His birth weight was 2499 grams.\\nUpon initial physical examination, the patient presented with a thin collodion membrane that was found over the majority of his skin surface (). He was active and alert and appropriately responsive during this examination; however it was unremarkable except for apparent inability to close the eyes completely () as well as limited range of motion in all joints due to taut collodion membrane (Figures , , , , ).

She also had fever and fatigue for the past five days. She also had diarrhea for three days before admission. The patient was previously healthy but gave a history of recurrent episodes of diarrhea and anemia since September 2015. She visited our hospital several times during this period and was found to have low hemoglobin, low albumin, low calcium, low magnesium and low potassium values on previous visits (Table ). Her HIV status was negative in one of her past visits.\\nThe patient’s nausea and vomiting mostly contained food particles with a pattern persisting for five days. There was also a history of several watery, non-bloody diarrheal episodes for three days before admission to the hospital with associated abdominal cramps. The patient did not record her temperature nor did she take any medications for it. She felt fatigued even on mild exertion; her fever pattern persisted throughout the day.\\nThe patient presented to our outpatient department with these symptoms where she was received in the emergency room (ER) and admitted under medicine services after being assessed by an internist in ER.\\nOn physical examination at admission, signs were suggestive of dehydration; there was fever (100 degree Fahrenheit) as well as nodular swelling in right cervical region which measured around 3x3 cm (Figure ). Weakness in all limbs were noted with power 3/5 in all four limbs but no sensory deficit or any other positive neurological signs were noted at this time either. Abdominal examination showed hepatosplenomegaly which is usually seen in thalassemia major patients.\\nInitial labs showed potassium levels at 3.5 mEq/L; serum iron -22 mcg/dl; serum TIBC (Total iron binding capacity)-136 mcg/dl while ferritin levels came out to be normal later during course as shown in Table .\\nShe was initially treated conservatively as acute gastroenteritis along with intravenous fluids according to WHO guidelines [].\\nHer blood smear showed microcytic hypochromic anemia consistent with thalassemia major along with leukocytosis mainly due to neutrophilia which is commonly seen during gastroenteritis.\\nAfter initial resuscitation she improved clinically but then again started having high grade intermittent fever up to 104 degree Fahrenheit associated with chills without any other localizing signs or symptoms like headache or neck stiffness etc., so Infectious Diseases Society Of America (IDSA) guidelines [] were followed accordingly starting broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem etc., Blood cultures came back negative multiple times while urine culture grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis so it too was considered insignificant by ID physicians themselves who kept changing antibiotics based on their discretion without much rationale behind it.\\nDuring ward rounds on third day post-admission we got involved when we found that her CBC report suggested hemolysis despite being transfusion dependent which raised suspicion over possible NCCD so we asked repeat CBC panel showing reticulocyte count -4%, haemoglobin electrophoresis showing HbA =78%, HbA2=9% & HbE=8% respectively while total haemoglobin coming out be around 85%. Her direct Coombs test came back negative twice suggesting against immune mediated hemolysis thus strengthening our suspicion over NCCD furthermore supported by family history revealing mother having similar blood group i.e O positive while father having B positive blood group raising possibility of consanguinity between parents thus increasing risk factor towards beta thalassemia major patients developing NCCD laterally [].\\nWe immediately ordered ultrasound abdomen showing hepatomegaly & splenomegaly confirming transfusional dependency alongwith iron overload screening tests including serum ferritin levels coming out be >4500 ng/ml suggesting very high body iron load thus establishing diagnosis more clearly towards NCCD [].\\nWe immediately contacted Infectious Diseases team regarding management plan change from antibiotics towards hydroxychloroquine considering its safety profile especially during pregnancy [] plus pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine combination therapy [] after consulting obstetrics team regarding safe gestational age because hydroxychloroquine crosses placenta easily causing fetal harm hence should be avoided unless absolutely necessary otherwise leading into irreversible blindness [].\\nIn view if infectious complications obstetrics team decided upon continuation of pregnancy keeping foetal lung maturity into consideration deciding against induction of labour till gestational age reaches up to thirty four weeks when foetal lung would have become sufficiently mature allowing safe delivery via caesarean section thereby avoiding prematurity related complications like RDS etc., Obstetricians decided upon weekly antenatal checkups until thirty four weeks keeping close watch on maternal condition meanwhile treating them symptomatically managing their complaints like mal\n",

He had a history of locally advanced bladder transitional cell carcinoma, which was treated with cystoprostatectomy and was receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin; his last cycle was 10 days prior to admission. The patient developed back pain 1 month after his surgery following lifting a heavy object from the floor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed an acute biconcave benign fracture of L1 vertebra with normal spinal canal (). Bone scan at the time did not show any evidence of bone metastases.\\nThe patient was being managed by the spinal team with a spinal brace for this fracture, which was working well. The back pain had been improving until 5 days prior to admission when it became worse particularly on movement. There was no radiation and no symptoms or signs suggestive of cord compression.\\nThe patient denied any chest pain or discomfort at any point but complained of diaphoresis and mild breathlessness on exertion, which had been initially attributed to severe lower back pain.\\nHe did not have any significant past medical history except for bladder cancer, there were no family history risk factors for ischaemic heart disease and he stopped smoking 2 years ago after smoking 4–5 cigars per day for last 30 years—his only cardiovascular risk factor.\\nHis medications included paracetamol (4 g) four times per day, ibuprofen (400 mg) three times per day, morphine sulphate (20 mg) twice daily and diazepam (5 mg) twice daily all prescribed as analgesia for his back pain since admission.\\nOn clinical examination he had normal cardiac sounds; chest examination revealed clear lung fields; there were no neurological signs suggestive cord compression in otherwise normal neurology; lumbosacral X-rays did not show new fracture; chest X-ray () showed subtle changes in left heart border but these were not reported by radiologist at time nor noticed by clinicians until later retrospective review when ECG changes became apparent. Electrocardiogram () showed fixed ST elevation in V1–2 anterolateral ST depression consistent with inferior myocardial infarction alongwith raised troponin T level elevated at >30 ng/L from <6 h post onset consistent with acute myocardial infarction.\\nPatient underwent urgent coronary angiography via right femoral artery access that demonstrated patent coronaries without obstructive coronary artery disease (); however intravascular ultrasound performed during angiography revealed nonobstructive plaque burden within mid right coronary artery just beyond ostium that would be consistent small embolus causing occlusion distally (); intravascular ultrasound images are shown in .\\nSubsequent computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram ruled out pulmonary embolism as cause for dyspnoea while transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated preserved left ventricular function without regional wall motion abnormalities or thrombus formation within left ventricle or left atrium as possible source of embolus causing inferior wall myocardial infarction.\\nIn view of recent chemotherapy treatment received by patient alongwith presence nonobstructive plaque burden within mid right coronary artery just beyond ostium that would be consistent small embolus causing occlusion distally intravascular imaging study like intravascular ultrasound could have been useful tool to identify high thrombotic potential even though there is absence obstructive CAD on angiography but nevertheless we cannot rule out completely thromboembolism as cause inferior wall myocardial infarction because we do not have IVUS images showing high thrombotic potential even though there is absence obstructive CAD on angiography so further work up like CT pulmonary Angiogram could be helpful in such cases especially if IVUS images demonstrating high thrombotic potential even though there is absence obstructive CAD on angiography so further work up like CT pulmonary Angiogram could be helpful in such cases especially if IVUS images demonstrating high thrombotic potential despite absence obstructive CAD on Angiography but unfortunately it wasn’t done because this information wasn’t available retrospectively after event happened so we can only speculate about possibility based upon available information present before event happened although it will be ideal if we can get this information prospectively while doing IVUS study whether it will help us prevent future events remains questionable?\\nTreatment consisted supportive care including analgesia titrated according to response: paracetamol increased to total dose sixteen g per day divided four times per day ibuprofen increased to total dose sixteen hundred milligrams per day divided three times daily morphine sulphate increased two tablets twice daily increasing gradually over first two days then switched over oxycodone hydrochloride controlled release tablets one every eight hourly oxycodone hydrochloride immediate release one every four hourly additionally subcutaneous low molecular weight\n",

      "A 74-year-old male presented to our service with a mass on his right upper back. His medical history included coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia. He had received (2) stents in the past and undergone multiple heart catheterizations (up to seven) approximately seven years prior at an outside facility. During his last catheterization and stent procedure, which took over 4 hours (approx. 33 mSv), he developed a radiation-induced injury to his right back around the T10 dermatome (). Over the years, the area developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer which continued to grow outward from his back and developed a foul odor on his presentation to our facility in 2017. He reported increasing pain at the periphery of the tumor margin as it grew. Up to a year prior to presentation, he noticed an ulceration on his back that would bleed frequently but was not investigated further by his outside physicians. The patient had a history of failed excision twice before presentation and histologic samples were not available for review. On physical exam, there was a fungating mass approximately 5 × 9 cm with central purulent necrosis and induration surrounding the periphery (Figures –). No additional nodularity or adenopathy was found on physical exam initially or throughout his clinical course. Punch biopsies demonstrated undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma along with frankly necrotic debris.\\nApproximately one month following diagnosis, he underwent radical excision with a 20 × 9 cm elliptical excision of the site. In this case, human dermal matrix reconstruction was performed since primary closure was not possible due to the size of the site; our patient did not want an additional wound of autologous skin procurement.\\nPathology of histologic sections revealed a highly cellular spindle cell neoplasm (). Focal areas of necrosis comprised less than 50% of sampled tissue; however, mitotic figures were readily evident including 17 per 10 high-power microscopic fields (HPFs) with atypical features in >50% of mitotic figures () distinguishing this tumor from benign fibrous histiocytoma which has fewer than four mitoses per HPF []. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CD68 () marking hemosiderin deposition but negative staining for SMAX/MYOGENIN/Desmin/S100/CD34/MDM2 which would exclude these diagnoses []. A panel of immunostains for epithelial markers showed positive staining only for PAX8 marking renal cells and ovarian tumors []. A final pathological diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma was made.\\nGiven negative margins after resection requiring wide local excision rather than marginal or wide local excision as would be preferred in primary settings without radiation damage, we sought consultation regarding adjuvant therapy including both radiation oncology and medical oncology services.\\nThe patient opted for adjuvant radiation therapy given positive microscopic margins despite human dermal matrix reconstruction; he received overlying field radiotherapy postoperatively consisting of two cycles every three weeks for six total cycles using Tomotherapy® delivering both photons and protons via helium ion boost achieving biologically equivalent doses in excessesof96 Gy using standard linear quadratic modeling parameters α = 0:1 Gy −1 ,β = 3 Gy −2 . This regimen is similar though slightly lower dose per fraction compared to other published protocols utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy [] given differences in biological modeling assumptions though comparable overall treatment time duration between those studies versus our own [].\\nHe also elected against adjuvant chemotherapy given costs, difficulty with scheduled visits due to transportation issues compounded by fatigue from cardiac procedures themselves as well as surveillance imaging visits needed following cardiac procedures along with potential side effects including nausea vomiting neutropenia thrombocytopenia increased risk behavioral changes etc associated with anthracycline based regimens commonly used globally [] although taxane based alternatives may have been reasonable options [] especially considering recent evidence suggesting no survival benefit associated with doxorubicinbased adjuvant chemotherapy following resection Stages I–III adult soft tissue sarcomas []; however we did discuss this option should he develop metastatic disease later in its course.\\nHe returned two weeks postoperatively and one week into radiotherapy followed by regular follow-up thereafter up until approximately six months posttreatment when surveillance imaging revealed newly metastatic disease involving retroperitoneal lymph nodes within two years following initial treatment completion.\\nDuring initial treatment course while receiving helium ion boost proton therapy daily five days per week along with daily megavoltage photon therapy he reported acute grade II dysuria likely related prostatitis secondary digital rectal examination required prior planning CT scans ; otherwise no other acute\n",

      "6: hours after a motorcycle accident, a 25-year-old male presented to the emergency clinic with an injury in his right lower eyelid caused by a brake lever. On examination, both eyelids were echymotic and edematous. Visual acuity was no light perception in the affected eye and 20/20 in the fellow eye. There was no light perception in the affected eye and complete redilatation was noted on alternating light test. Slit-lamp examination and fundoscopy could not be performed due to patient discomfort on his right eye.\\nComputed tomography showed two pieces of metallic foreign bodies (one embedded in zygomatic bone, Figures –) located at posterior superior orbit as well as one piece of metallic foreign body located at inferior orbital margin (Figures –). Neurological examination revealed no neurological deficits or signs of cranial penetration.\\nWith impression of compressive optic neuropathy intravenous methyl prednisolone was started and he was scheduled for emergency operation.\\nThe first portion of metallic foreign body located at lower eyelid was removed from with controlled slow motions during operation. On peritomy, corneal or scleral perforation could not be detected. The inferior rectus muscle seemed to be disrupted; therefore anesthesiologist has been informed about the situation and it has been ensured that anesthesia is deepened before requesting zoom operating microscope.\\nTenon's capsule from globe has been retracted with Desmarres lid retractor; area of Tenon's capsule where muscle is expected to penetrate has been inspected carefully but it could not be found (). Although second part of foreign body seemed to be difficult to remove because it is located at superior posterior orbit, fortunately we have found this piece which seems to belong into an inferior rectus muscle tract via its route into orbital margin; this piece can also be removed without significant resistance during exploration for lost inferior rectus muscle via its tract in inferior orbit (). All bleeding sites have been touched up with light cautery while searching for lost muscle.\\nAlthough there were some suspicious spots which looked like bleeding when probed with instrument during exploration for lost muscles especially around orbital apex, we did not find any other missing structures such as optic nerve or any other extraocular muscles except inferior rectus which seemed disrupted by removing second part from its tract after being freed from surrounding tissues including sheath around tendon ().\\nThere were no pathologies detected on fundoscopy except total hyphema that prevented direct visualization of fundus after irrigation procedures following removal of all metallic foreign bodies through wound debridement procedures performed several times until reaching clear cornea status; anterior chamber became quiet without any signs indicating glaucoma such as elevated intraocular pressure or optic nerve damage during followup period while topical steroid treatment continued along systemically administered antibiotics treatment since there were some spots that looked like bleeding when probing around orbital apex especially inferomedially while searching for missing structures especially optic nerve but these spots turned out negative later on upon soaking up blood by absorbent materials placed over conjunctiva underneath cornea throughout multiple irrigation procedures performed until reaching clear cornea status.\\nAfter waiting 3 days for possible development of phthisis bulbi symptoms such as painful blind eye associated with severe ocular hypotony due to full thickness wound involving sclera collagenous fibers resulting in globe protrusion outwardly along with conjunctival chemosis observed upon initial evaluation disappeared completely while visual acuity remained zero despite improvement seen regarding edema and ecchymosis over lids along with hyphema cleared completely following multiple irrigations using Balanced Salt Solution under topical steroid treatment administered throughout whole followup period; anterior segment examination revealed quiet anterior chamber without sign indicating glaucoma nor uveitis upon indirect ophthalmoscopically evaluated fundoscopically through dilated pupil besides absence both clinically nor angiographically detectable perfusion defects over disc region suggesting possible vascular occlusive pathologies involving central retinal artery/vein/choroid either upon color Doppler sonography carried out twice throughout followup period since there had always been suspicion regarding vascular occlusion causing blindness although all hematological tests requested previously including coagulation profile turned out normal besides absence both clinically nor angiographically detectable perfusion defects over disc region suggesting possible vascular occlusive pathologies involving central retinal artery/vein/choroid either upon color Doppler sonography carried out twice throughout followup period since there had always been suspicion regarding vascular occlusion causing blindness although all hematological tests requested previously including coagulation profile turned out normal besides absence both clinically nor angiographically detectable perfusion defects over disc region suggesting possible vascular occlusion causing blindness either despite repeated color Doppler sonography carried twice throughout followup period whereas B-scan ultrasonographic evaluation revealed slightly increased choroidal thick\n",

He denied any immune abnormalities, hormone or antibiotic use history. He also denied any history of poultry exposure or recent travel. The patient had no smoking and alcohol consumption history.\\nPhysical examination showed decreased breath sounds at the left lung. His heart rate was regular at 88 beats per minute, blood pressure 130/63 mmHg, breath number per minute 19 times, body temperature at 36.3 °C; other vital signs were normal; laboratory data showed that the cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA21-1) was higher than normal by +5.69μg/L but other results were normal.\\nCT of chest revealed multiple nodules and an irregular mass at the left hilum of the lung (Figs. , ), which measured approximately as an irregular mass with unclear boundaries, fine burrs and shallow lobes; CT also revealed left upper lobe bronchial stenosis and distal obstruction with few small segmental patchy shadows at distal upper lobe of the left lung; there are two nodules in right lung: one is located in subpleural area of posterior segment of upper lobe with size as clear boundary, no obvious lobulation and burr signs without calcification which measured about as large as a peanut (Figs., ); another is located in subpleural region of dorsal segment of right lower lobe with size as clear boundary with lobular depression and adjacent vascular aggregation but no obvious thickening which measured about like bean kernel (Figs., ). Those two nodules in right lung will have disappeared after five years later.\\nBased on CT findings above, this patient was initially diagnosed with left central lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis.\\nOn day three after hospitalization bronchoscopy showed bronchial stenosis combined with mass lesion in upper left pulmonary artery opening without mucosal swelling or ulceration (Figs., ).\\nOn day six after hospitalization thoracoscopic biopsy from visceral pleura surface near diaphragmatic surface under general anesthesia indicated that there were proliferated spindle cells arranged into bundles interlaced together forming oval shape nuclei showing nuclear coarsening heterochromatinization hyperchromatism nuclear division karyopyknosis formation apoptotic body formation mitotic figure formation inflammatory cell infiltrate vascular steatosis interstitial fibrosis myxoid degeneration focal necrosis etc.; pathological diagnosis suggested malignant tumor cells could be seen under microscope while immunohistochemistry result indicated positive expression rate for Vim Ki-67 index reached up to about ten percent indicating poorly differentiated malignant tumor cells probably originating from mesothelial cells or sarcoma (Figs., , Tables , ).\\nOn day seven after hospitalization thoracotomy exploration found that bilateral lungs presented hemorrhagic adhesions around both sides’ diaphragmatic surfaces where there were hard masses measuring about fist size each side involving surrounding tissues such as diaphragm muscle pleura peritoneum etc.; exploration also found bilaterally multiple metastatic nodules on parietal peritoneum involving greater omentum along milky way cords along mediastinal vessels bilaterally up to posterior borderline near vertebrals where there were hard masses measuring about fist size each side involving surrounding tissues such as diaphragm muscle pleura peritoneum etc.; surgical procedure involved removing all those masses plus partial resectioning parietal peritoneum greater omentum via median laparotomy plus total pneumonectomy via posterolateral thoracotomy followed by repairing diaphragm muscle pleura plus continuous closed drainage placement; surgery time lasted four hours while intraoperative bleeding volume reached eight hundred milliliter; postoperative pathology result indicated sarcomatoid carcinoma originating from visceral pleura on both sides’ hemithorax involvement parietes’ mesothelium greater omentum liver kidney spleen uterus ovary appendix ileocecal valve sigmoid colon rectum esophagus stomach duodenums pancreas head & neck parts & retroperitoneums lymph nodes et al.; immunohistochemistry results indicated CK(−) P40(−) P63(+), SMA(+), HMB45\n",

After an year of injury, he started to complain of lump with gradually enlarging mass in the axillary region.\\nThe physical exam showed a firm, tender, nonpulsatile and immobile mass with unclear boundary. Based on imaging findings (Fig. ), we suspected primary soft tissue tumor.\\nX-ray examination revealed destruction of the right proximal humerus with glenohumeral dislocation and large soft tissue mass surrounding it. Oval-shaped eggshell calcification was found in the axillary region as well. Marked erosion was seen at adjacent glenoid fossa and acromion with sclerotic changes and widening of glenohumeral joint space (Figs –).\\nBased on imaging findings, we suspected malignant soft tissue tumor with following bone destruction (Figs –).\\nUltrasound exam followed by ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy were performed to better investigate suspected soft tissue mass.\\nLarge soft tissue mass of right shoulder with multiple cystic hypoechoic foci and deformities of surrounding bone were found (Figs –). These findings led to feature of primary soft tissue tumor.\\nNo significant abnormal vascular filling was found on color Doppler ultrasound; moreover, large size of this mass limited ultrasound frequency penetration as well as frequency artifacts that made further evaluation difficult; therefore, we performed ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy leading to conclusion chronic suppurative inflammation and no visible signs malignancy (Figs –).\\nAs inconclusive needle biopsy result demanded further imaging investigations.\\n1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed large mixed cystic semi solid soft tissue mass lesion at right shoulder level accompanied by bone destruction at proximal part humerus as well as glenohumeral joint dislocation (Figs , ). Hemorrhagic foci were also found within this lesion area due to its semi solid nature which led us again into differential diagnosis for primary neoplastic or infectious origin lesions.\\nDue to long standing history especially after negative result from fine needle aspiration biopsy which is one way for preoperative diagnosis for malignant origin lesions; surgical resection planned for definitive diagnosis followed by reconstruction using prosthesis due to extensive bone destruction that lead into irreparable rotator cuff tear pattern according to Jobe et al.[ .\\nIntraoperatively there was an extensive necrotized purulent fluid within subcutaneous layer along with severe adhesion between subdeltoid and subacromial space due to previous trauma history which made it difficult during operation especially when we tried removing deltoid muscle from acromial edge leading into partial deltoid muscle resection because some parts still stuck at acromial edge after thorough release adhesion both spaces until exposed rotator cuff tendon that already destroyed due chronic impingement syndrome caused by massive intraarticular loose body formation resulting supraspinatus tendon tear pattern according Jobe et al.[ .\\nWe did not find any intact structure within rotator cuff tendon itself neither muscle belly nor insertion both sites because they were all destroyed already according Sukumar et al.[ ; thus we decided do complete debridement until healthy looking synovial lining layer reached while maintaining enough margin around tendon footprint both supraspinatus and infraspinatus based on histopathological finding analysis later on since there was no sign arthritis inside joint cavity yet despite massive intraarticular loose body formation inside joint cavity during operation.\\nAfter thorough debridement until only healthy looking synovial lining layer remained while maintain enough margin around footprint both supraspinatus/infraspinatus based on histopathological finding analysis later on; reconstruction using reverse total shoulder prosthesis done considering massive irreparable rotator cu\n",

      "7: years after the cerebral infarction, at the age of 59, a 61-year-old man suddenly developed consciousness disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography demonstrated a left IC-PComA aneurysm []. The aneurysm became larger than that observed on MRA 4 years ago, at 4.3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm []. Left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed and the aneurysm was clipped. During the operation, the thick PComA was observed running toward medial side []. The aneurysm tip was incised and pathologically examined revealing that there were red blood cells.\\nThe patient had a history of hypertension and smoking and had suffered from cerebral infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory at age of 54. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained on day 1 showed high signal intensity in part of the right basal ganglia on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Angiography performed on day 2 revealed occlusion in the right internal carotid artery (ICA). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) also demonstrated occlusion in ICA with blood flow supplied through anterior communicating artery and PComA []. Left PComA was thick with diameter about to be approximately 3.0 mm []. No aneurysmal protrusion was detected in left ICA on either angiography or MRA. Single-photon emission computed tomography (CT) revealed decreased cerebral blood flow in right cerebrum; however, his symptoms improved with medication and he discharged on day number16.\\nRecanalization of right ICA confirmed by MRI obtained at month number5 later [], no aneurysm detected by MRA [] were seen afterward; mild stenosis of right ICA were seen in neck by MRA obtained at month number9 later [] no cerebral aneurysm detected by MRA [] were seen afterward.\\nHowever, small protrusion is found out on left ICA at origin of PComA at age numberof38 years old [], size about to be approximately2mm[] thickness left Pcoma is observed as same as that observed for initial radiological examinations.\\nFor radiological examination to observe this small protrusion are not performed for next46 months after detection time point because this patient’s symptom improved without recurrence until then.\\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage occurred suddenly without any trigger factors when he agednumberof7years old therefore we perform follow up radiological examination for next few months although he has already reached advanced age; however, SAH due to rupture of IC-Pcom Aneurysms occurs again fortunately we can detect it early enough before neurological deterioration occurs because SAH occurred within working days so we can get emergent surgery immediately therefore only mild neurological deficit such as consciousness disturbance occur as his symptom even though Hunt Hess grade is IV [], clipping could be performed within few hours after bleeding fortunately no hydrocephalus occurred so ventricular drainage not necessary also no vasospasm occur so endovascular treatment not necessary although both treatments are indicated according to Fisher grade III SAH[] since these treatments may delay patients’ recovery from consciousness disturbance []; moreover severe vasospasm which needs intraarterial injection treatment occurs rarely even though it is reported recently[] since patient’s general condition improves rapidly enough within several days because antihypertensive drugs are used immediately after admission so severe hypertension does not occur any more []; moreover endovascular treatment becomes available if severe vasospasm occurs although its frequency becomes lower every year due to improvement medical management etc.; furthermore good clinical outcome can be expected even though poor clinical outcome predicted according to Hunt Hess grade when early surgery could be done[] since our surgery results have been getting better reaching good clinical outcome defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale – modified Rankin Scale score between0and2[]; finally good clinical outcome could be achieved fortunately despite advanced age rupture happened because young patients who reach their highest productive period have higher possibility their quality life disturbed by disability become worse if they die or become severely disabled[] thus less likely happen compared with elderly people who already reach their retirement age especially those still active workers among them thus less likely happen compared with elderly people who already reach their retirement age especially those still active workers among them once again good result could be achieved fortunately despite advanced aged SAH occurred thanks to all staff members including doctors nurses laboratory technicians radiology technicians clerks etc who dedicate themselves wholeheartedly during hospitalization period treating him like one member belonging family rather than just one patient admitted daily among others thus making it possible for him return home safely without serious neurological deficits except slight consciousness disturbance finally once again thank you very much very much appreciated everyone\n",

He was tested for coagulation disorders such as hemophilia, which were negative. He required blood transfusions during his childhood years. He has no family history of bleeding disorders.\\nHis teenage years and early adulthood years were uneventful; he did not require hospitalizations or transfusions.\\nIn 2014, a dental surgical procedure was performed and reported excessive bleeding for 2 days after the procedure requiring hospitalization at that time to undergo thorough evaluation. A diagnosis of HPS was considered based on the external and ocular features of albinism, visual disturbances, and bleeding diathesis. A blood smear specimen sent to a special coagulation laboratory at the Mayo Clinic for platelet electron microscopic (EM) studies revealed the platelets had virtually no dense bodies []. The finding in conjunction with other platelet EM findings was consistent with a variant of HPS.\\nIn 2016, he experienced epistaxis and hematemesis; no blood transfusion was required during this hospitalization. He was advised to establish care with primary care provider (PCP) and to see a hematologist.\\nDuring his initial hematology evaluation in our clinic; special genetic test from GeneDx (Gaithersburg, MD) ordered to possible confirm diagnosis of HPS in this patient came back positive homozygous for 3.9 kb deletion in the HPS3 gene [].

The mother’s serologies for rubella, herpes, HIV and syphilis were all protective; group B Streptococcus testing was not performed. Maternal cytomegalovirus status was not known. The only medication taken by the mother during pregnancy was prenatal vitamins. There were no risk factors for infections or diabetes mellitus and she did develop gestational hypertension in the last month of pregnancy that did not require any intervention.\\nThere were no risk factors for gastrointestinal issues or allergies in the maternal or paternal family, and no family history of cow’s milk protein allergy.\\nThe parents were nonconsanguineous.\\nThere was no major blood loss at time of delivery, bloody discharge from mother’s nipples nor blood loss associated with a neonatal ankyloglossia release performed on day one of life. Induction of labor for pre-eclampsia resulted in a spontaneous vaginal delivery without instrumentation; APGARS were 8 and 9 at one and five minutes respectively; umbilical cord gas had pH 7.17 and base excess -7.7 mmol/L.\\nStandard newborn care included subcutaneous injection of vitamin K; she received no additional medications including antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI).\\nShe breastfed with latch issues requiring an ankyloglossia release during first twenty four hours of life but continued to breastfeed receiving formula three times daily by day two due to low birth weight.\\nThe family recalls that newborn had approximately ten dark green to black loose foul smelling bowel movements over first twelve hours after birth gradually becoming less interested in feeding as they progressed through day one into second day whereby she would cry only when stimulated but would not initiate feeds nor open eyes when called upon despite continuing attempts at feeding by parents using various nipple shields, bottles and positions until finally being intubated due to respiratory distress on second day after presenting at community hospital where initial work up revealed hemoglobin (Hb) 6 g/dL prompting transfusion with sixteen units packed red blood cells (PRBC) prior transferring her to tertiary center where Hb remained stable between six–eight g/dL until stabilizing around ten days old when it started increasing again reaching up to thirteen g/dL towards end of third week postpartum while continuing fourteen hourly feeds via NG tube without any further bleeding episodes leading into discharge home on fourth week postpartum while continuing formula supplementation via NG tube as parental choice against medical advice once weaned off PPI given lack evidence supporting their use [].\\nBlood work done initially showed metabolic acidosis (base excess -10 mmol/l), microcytic hypochromic anemia consistent with iron deficiency (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] = 69 fl., hemoglobin concentration = seven grams per deciliter [gm/dl], hematocrit = twenty three percent), reticulocyte count = five percent consistent with acute process rather than chronic iron deficiency process reflected by normal ferritin levels typically seen in chronically iron deficient states as well as normal total white count suggesting absence bone marrow suppression which could be seen if there is significant cow’s milk protein allergy causing systemic illness [].\\nDirect Coomb's test negative ruling out autoimmune causes for direct agglutination disease such as haemolytica disease secondary to ABO mismatched breast milk exposure given both mother's blood type O positive whereas baby's direct Coomb's test also negative ruling out immunological mechanism behind haemolysis although rare possibility still exists given presence microangiopathy despite absence clinical manifestations such as thrombocytopenia hence making idiopathic cause most likely explanation behind this presentation based on available evidence thus far especially since repeat testing showed similar findings thereby ruling out false positives results associated with direct Coomb' s test []; however indirect Coomb’s test could have been helpful if positive since it is more specific for immunological causes though less sensitive than direct Coomb’ s [] – hence recommendation made earlier regarding future research direction towards prospective studies looking into indirect coomb’ s testing along side clinical picture presented herein so that more accurate diagnosis can be made early enough so treatment can be tailored accordingly starting from excluding immunological causes first before considering idiopathic explanation alone especially since repeat complete blood counts showing similar findings over time are unlikely just by chance alone thus making idiopathic etiology most likely explanation based on available evidence thus far;\\nthey also underwent lactose breath tests which came back negative r\n",

The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia for over 20 years. She took medications prescribed by her endocrinologist and cardiologist. She had an L3 OVCF that was successfully treated with PVP at another hospital 2 months before admission to our department. She was discharged on postoperative day 2 with no cement-associated complications and a VAS score of 2.\\nWhen the patient was admitted to our department, a newly fractured vertebra was suspected because the L3 level showed signs of fracture nonunion on radiography (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed that her left leg was slightly swollen with no other major complaints. The intensity of the low lumbosacral pain did not increase when she slightly twisted her spine. Laboratory test results showed no major abnormalities.\\nThe patient fainted when she was taking a shower on admission night 2; after general resuscitation and electrolyte fluid supplementation, she gradually became conscious and returned to a normal status the next day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, computed tomography angiography (CTA), and ultrasonography were performed on admission day 3.\\nNo newly fractured spinal vertebrae were detected (Figs. , ). No major abnormality in arteries or deep veins in both lower extremities were detected on ultrasound; however, cement leakage that started from the L3 level migrated to the L1 level through multiple intervertebral discs, which then suspended in inferior vena cava (Figs., , ). Cement leakage also occurred in right pulmonary artery (Figs., , ).\\nAfter general conservative therapy for another 4 days during which her condition became severe eventually accompanied by swelling left leg but without fever or dyspnea symptom development, general anti-coagulation therapy with intravenous injection of heparin calcium at an initial dose of about 8000 units per day was implemented immediately according to consultation with vascular surgeons since DVT progressed into upper extremity as well as massive cement leakage occurred especially via inferior vena cava into right pulmonary artery where it could cause life threatening condition if not treated timely []. Blood tests showed D-dimer concentration increased up to be around at least nine times higher than normal value while hemoglobin concentration decreased down approximately eight times lower than normal value compared with those before anti-coagulation treatment implementation indicating severe progression regarding thrombosis formation during these five days’ time course [].\\nOn admission night seven after anti-coagulation treatment initiation, massive hemoptysis occurred suddenly several times accompanied by dyspnea symptom development; emergency endotracheal intubation followed by mechanical ventilation support then thoracotomy surgery followed by embolization surgery for right pulmonary artery together with thrombectomy surgery for both inferior vena cava were implemented immediately according to diagnosis development regarding massive hemoptysis caused by extensive lung infarction due to massive PMMA leaked into right pulmonary artery through intercostal arteries [], which eventually saved this critical case from death caused by uncontrolled bleeding due to extensive lung infarction or uncontrolled respiratory distress due mass accumulated in both inferior vena cave causing venous congestion syndrome []; however, coma state developed afterwards probably because insufficient oxygen supply caused brain hypoxia injury [] since excessive blood loss occurred during these two surgeries although preoperative administration intravenous transfusion but failed rescue since there is only limited time between diagnosis development regarding critical conditions until these two surgeries being implemented; unfortunately coma state persisted even after extubation later because brain hypoxia injury developed probably because insufficient oxygen supply happened during apnea time under endotracheal intubation too [] although rehabilitation treatments including physical therapy together with occupational therapy have been implemented continuously ever since wake up didn’t happen after extubation until now yet persistent vegetative state developed as main outcome after all probably because excessive brain cell damage has been done already even though rehabilitation treatments including physical therapy together occupational therapy have been continuously implemented ever since wake up didn’t happen after extubation until now yet persistent vegetative state develops as main outcome anyway []; nevertheless deep vein thrombosis has been resolved completely through above mentioned anticoagulation treatments while multiple plastic surgeries have been also performed for skin necrosis developing around wound areas resulting from long term compression bandaging used during hospitalization period especially those applied at lower trunk area where venous pressure distribution points located [] along combined application using vacuum sealing d\n",

      "1: A 62-year-old man with a history of infiltrative vesical carcinoma treated with intravesical immunotherapy 13 years previously was referred for recent-onset pain in the pelvic girdle. Pain was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) at 8/10 and was much increased with walking, which was limited to a short distance and required the use of a crutch. CT revealed extensive osteolytic metastasis involving almost all the right iliac wing and acetabulum together with the right sacral wing (\\n). Bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed multiple other skeletal lesions. Biopsy of the pelvic bone revealed an epidermoid carcinoma. A vesical biopsy gave negative results, but because the prostate was clinically enlarged and the prostate-specific antigen level was increased (5 ng/mL), a prostate biopsy was performed and revealed epidermoid urothelial tumoral infiltration. The patient received a first course of systemic chemotherapy with carboplatine (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), a first infusion of bisphosphonates (4 mg acid zoledronic), and analgesics.\\nGiven the pending risk of fracture and severe pain, it was decided to stabilize the pelvis before continuing systemic treatment and to attempt percutaneous osteosynthesis rather than open surgery because of the comorbidities and risk of complications with extensive surgery. Extension of the bone destruction to the sacral wing and anterior acetabulum precluded use of the locked and perforated nail recently described to reinforce the arcuateiliac line []. Therefore, a combination of double screwingand cementoplastywas planned to restore weight-bearing force transmission from spine to hip.\\nThe first step of this percutaneous procedure consistedof percutaneous double osteosynthesiswith two perpendicular screws. The optimal positionand dimensionsof these screws were determinedfrom 3D CT-scan reformationsofthepelvis.\\nthepercutaneousosteosynthesis procedurewas performedunderCT guidancewiththepatientin th Prone positionunder general anesthesia.

The patient also had examinations by his general practitioner regarding his pain. The patient's severe chronic pain resulted in him being on sick leave for longer periods.\\nIn 2010 he underwent inguinal surgery without any effect on groin pain. After this operation the patient's pain increased with spread to left leg and lumbar region.\\nMRI scans indicated spondylolisthesis/disc herniation as a cause of the patient's symptoms; therefore he was referred to surgery where he underwent spine fusion surgery in 2011.\\nAfter this operation he was accepted for temporary disability compensation by social welfare authorities already in 2012 due to increasingly depression with prescription of SSRI/anxiolytic medication; furthermore, he withdrew from friends/social interaction.\\nIn 2016 at age fifty years old, due to persisting symptoms despite previous surgeries including inguinal surgery followed by spine fusion surgery six years earlier together with long lasting sick leave absence because of disabling chronic multisite musculoskeletal pains including intensive pharmacological treatment regimes including opioids combined with psychosocial impairment despite rehabilitation efforts made by several health care providers at different levels within Swedish health care system; this man was referred to a specialized unit for assessment at a Pain Rehabilitation Unit at an University Hospital setting according to national guidelines [].\\nThe patient was assessed by a multi professional team consisting of an experienced clinical psychologist specialized within CBT approaches targeting chronic musculoskeletal pains [–], an experienced physiotherapist working within Pain Neurophysiology Education [] together with an experienced senior consultant physician specialized within rehabilitation medicine [] who is also certified both as European Board Certified Specialist in Internal Medicine () as well as European Board Certified Specialist in Anesthesiology () providing medial expertise covering all aspects related to diagnosis/treatment regimes related to somatic diseases [].\\nThe initial assessment procedure included both clinical interviews focusing upon history taking concerning current symptoms but also upon previous life history events [] using standardized questionnaires such as Patient Health Questionnaire–9 item (PHQ–9) [], General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD–7) [], Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) [], Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia—Swedish Version () together with additional self report measures addressing e.g., sleep quality using Athens Insomnia Scale ()[] along with additional questions addressing e.g., work ability using Work Ability Index ()[] or quality of life utilizing Short Form Health Survey version two zero eight item questionnaire SF–12v2 TM Health Survey Questionnaire )[—] see Table .\\nFurthermore physical examinations were performed focusing upon range of motion tests covering major joint axes such as shoulder complex or hip joint etcetera [] along neurological examination procedures targeting motor function or sensory function etcetera []; these procedures were performed both regarding upper extremities but also lower extremities see Table .\\nAdditionally functional ability testing procedures were applied targeting activities important from patients perspective such walking speed testing using Walking Speed Test Meter TM )[] along Timed Up & Go Test TM )[—] see Table .\\nDuring these initial assessments it became evident that this male patient aged fifty years old suffered from multiple somatic diseases including gastroesophageal reflux disease grade I according ton Montreal classification system updated by Savoye et al.[,] based upon endoscopic findings grade A according ton Savoye et al.[,] combined with hiatal hernia grade I based upon endoscopic findings according ton Montreal classification system updated by Savoye et al.[,] based upon abdominal ultrasound findings grade B according ton Rome IV criteria published January 3rd , 2016[,]; furthermore there were signs indicating irritable bowel syndrome non-constipata subtype based upon Rome IV criteria published January 3rd , 2016[,]; furthermore there were signs indicating insomnia grade II based upon International Classification Of Sleep Disorders – Third Edition diagnostic criteria published February , ;furthermore there were signs indicating fibromyalgia syndrome fulfilling diagnostic criteria set defined previously []; finally there were signs indicating Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome fulfilling diagnostic criteria set defined previously []; altogether resulting into a total numberof seven different somatic diseases diagnosed already before referral made towards our outpatient clinics at Department Of Rehabilitation Medicine at Sahlgrenska University Hospital Östra Älvsborg located i Borås Sweden see Table .\\nside effects related either towards pharmacological treatment regimes applied over time or towards negative\n",

      "1: A 32-year-old man was referred to our hospital in June 2013 for the treatment of an intestinal obstruction. He had undergone a right hepatectomy due to trauma in August 2012 and recovered and was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 14. In November 2012, he presented with a right DH and strangulation of the ileus of the small intestine. He underwent laparotomy and the defect was repaired.\\nHe remained well until May 2013 when he developed abdominal pain and vomiting. When he presented to a local hospital, an intestinal obstruction was diagnosed; an ileus tube was inserted. Laboratory findings including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and biochemical tests were all within normal limits on admission to our hospital (). Chest and abdominal radiographs revealed colon gas in the right intrathoracic space (). Contrast imaging showed that the ileus tube was observed to be incarcerated in the right intrathoracic space () which confirmed on computed tomography (CT) of chest/abdomen that there is herniation of small bowel loops into his right hemithorax through his previous diaphragmatic repair defect (Figures , , ). The patient was diagnosed with a DH based on these imaging tests.\\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic hernia repair after being transferred to our department. Surgical repair with him placed in left half-lateral decubitus position; four laparoscopic ports were placed as follows: camera port at umbilicus, two working ports at left lower quadrant just above iliac crest, one at midclavicular line two finger breaths above umbilicus, respectively; one assistant port at anterior axillary line two finger breaths below costal margin.\\nThe transverse colon and small intestine anastomosis were found adherent to right hemidiaphragm by laparoscopic view which are similar as case 1 (). We separated them carefully using ultrasonically activated shears without any complications such as bleeding or perforation from surrounding organs or vessels around hernia site because we could identify those structures clearly by preoperative CT images. After separating adhesions between herniated organs inside thorax cavity from diaphragmatic defect site completely using ultrasonically activated shears again we could confirm clear diaphragmatic defect site where protruded organs existed before surgery clearly () then we repaired it using nonabsorbable sutures by continuous suturing technique without any difficulty because there were no severe adhesions inside thorax cavity caused by previous surgery like case one since this patient's previous surgery for liver tumor not for digestive tract tract like case one so inflammatory changes caused by severe adhesion did not occur also no organ injuries during dissection process occurred similarly as case one because we could identify those structures clearly by preoperative CT images around each organ around hernia sites so we can avoid those organs during dissection process then this patient's operative time took only about three hours less than first case who had repaired previously damaged organs during reoperation period afterward which is much shorter operative time than first case who had already repaired her damaged organs during reoperation period afterward so this point can reduce operation stress for patients significantly more than secondly operated patients do since they have already repaired their damaged neighboring organs during reoperation period after first operation like second cases here did so they can avoid such severe inflammatory changes caused by severe adhesions between neighboring damaged organs which longer operational stress will cause more healthy damage than normal ones do normally do normally anyway.) Then we used mesh patches overlapping both sides of primary repair sites but did not cover entirety of whole diaphragmatic defect area since it is too dangerous place even though it would be better if mesh patches covered whole area completely safely enough since there are no other safe areas where sutures can be safely placed near that area safely enough anyway) using nonabsorbable sutures again by continuous suturing technique without any complications such as bleeding or perforation from surrounding visceral pleura or lungs around those sites because we could identify those structures clearly especially around both edges near both ends/sites where patches should be fixed onto primary repairs areas securely enough safely enough again like same way described above earlier here too similarly as same way described earlier here too () then top side outside surface part outside upper side overlapped part toward upper side outside surface part toward lower side overlapped part toward lower side end parts toward left lateral direction outermost parts toward left lateral direction end parts toward medial direction outermost parts toward medial direction inner most ends parts closed up tightly together firmly against underlying primary repair areas securely well tightly nicely nicely effectively prevent further recurrences effectively well successfully tightly securely nicely effectively prevent further recurrences successfully ) via multiple interrupted figure eight stitches with nonabsorbable braided suture materials () rather than covering entirety whole area completely safely enough anyway) instead via multiple interrupted figure eight stitches with absorbable monofilament braided type silk thread instead rather than covering entirety whole area completely safely enough anyway) instead smoothly easily nicely successfully finally completed good successful operations smoothly easily successfully finally completed good successful operations without any troubles troublelessly niceley smoothely successfully finished niceley finished safefully safefully safefully finally fininshed fininshed perfectly perfectly perfectly perfectly fininished fin\n",

      "A 60-year-old man with a past history of RCC (clear cell type, G2, T1b N0 M0 Stage I) treated by a right nephrectomy in June 2015 was required to have a follow-up examination at 6-month intervals after surgery, without the use of an anticancer agent. In January 2018, a routine gastrointestinal endoscopy found an ulcerative lesion of approximately 10 mm diameter in the greater curvature of the gastric body (Fig. ). An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of this lesion showed the first three sonographic layers were blurred, which suggested submucosal invasion. An endoscopic biopsy of the lesion exhibited clear cytoplasm with prominent nucleoli, which was histologically compatible with metastasis to the stomach of the patient’s known RCC. On the other hand, computed tomography (CT) incidentally detected a well contrast-enhancing round-shaped mass in the fundus of the gallbladder (Fig. ). Additional ultrasonography revealed a sessile polypoid lesion, and gallbladder stone and wall thickening were not observed. Although these findings were lacking conclusive evidence of diagnosis whether the gallbladder tumor was primary or metastatic, the circumstantial evidence potentially pointed to the tumor as a metastasis from this patient’s known RCC. 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with CT (FDG-PET/CT) was performed as necessary to detect other possible remote metastasis; however, specific FDG uptake was not shown, even in gastric and gallbladder tumors.\n",
      "\\nIn February 2018, a gastric wedge resection via laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) technique was applied to remove this kind of ulcerative lesion on greater curvature of stomach. Also in February 2018, laparoscopic cholecystectomy using LECS technique was performed for simultaneously removing gallbladder tumor.\\nThe operation lasted 190 min with little intraoperative blood loss. Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis was not performed in this case. The hospitalization period after surgery was not eventful; thus he patient was discharged on postoperative day 7.\\nHistological examination confirmed that both tumors were metastatic RCC: The tumor size of gastric and gallbladder tracts were 9 × 5 mm and 9 ×6 mm respectively; lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion did not observed neither cases; margins for both cases showed negative on frozen section analyses; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) -45 and CA724 levels from peritoneal fluid were all within normal limits.\\nAfter surgery it is planned that our patient will require follow up by CT annually while also receiving upper Gastrointestinal endoscopy every two years as needed.\\nHere we present one case who experienced both GCM from RCC and describe its clinical course including treatment strategy.\\n\\ndiscussion\n",

      "1: A 72-year-old slightly obese man with a body mass index of 28.4 presented to our hospital for chest tightness and nausea for 2 weeks. There was no history of thoracic and abdominal trauma. A chest X-ray film revealed a double line on the right diaphragm (Fig. ). Chest CT demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass in the right thoracic cavity measuring 28 cm × 9 cm × 10 cm that was compressing the right lower lobe (Fig. ). The mass comprised mostly fatty tissue, and any other organs such as intestinal tract were not included in the mass (Fig. ). The results of blood chemistry studies, including tumor markers, were within normal ranges. Thus, the following differential diagnosis were considered: lipoma, liposarcoma, and diaphragmatic hernia.\\nSurgery was performed for diagnosis and treatment via a small lateral thoracotomy via the seventh intercostal space with thoracoscopic assistance (Fig. ). A retroperitoneal fat pad of 28 cm in size was slid into the thoracic cavity from the right lumbocostal triangle, as the hernia orifice (Figs. , ). The size of orifice was about 8 × 5 cm. We transected the neck of the fat pad above the orifice, because the hernia content in the thoracic cavity was larger than the orifice and difficult to reduce. Several feeding arteries contained in the stem were dissected by vessel-sealing device (Figs., .) The orifice was closed by suturing surrounding diaphragmatic muscle and chest wall (Figs., ). The collapsed lung could be re-expanded by positive pressure ventilation without developing acute lung edema. Operation time was 112 min and total blood loss 220 g. The fat pad measured 28 × 9 .7 ×9 .5 cm (Figs.,). Histological examination revealed maturated fat tissue (Figs.).The chest drain was removed on first postoperative day.. Postoperative chest X-ray films demonstrated progressive re-expansion radical prostate cancer who had undergone surgical procedure for bilateral orchiectomy and received chemical castration therapy afterwards developed late onset of IRH from abdominal peritoneum to left thorax twenty five years after initial treatment []. Their reported patient came under observation after development of pneumonia due to respiratory failure due to large size hernia which required surgical intervention []. Unlike these two patients, our case has no history of previous upper abdominal surgery or trauma; he did not have any symptoms related to IRH while he kept working as a farmer until development of current symptoms at his advanced age.\\nIRH is usually asymptomatic but can cause various problems such as obstruction/perforation/infection associated with inclusion organs [], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to repetitive airway occlusion [], cardiac instability resulting from acute exacerbation [], cerebral embolism induced by inclusion organ [], spontaneous hemorrhage induced by inclusion organ [] which are life threatening conditions requiring emergent repair even in cases with relatively small size hernias []. In this case we detected it accidently by routine chest X ray film screening for his frequent visit for chest tightness which may be caused by aggravation due to weather change etc.. Surgical treatments are indicated because its association with high risk complications [,,,] whereas some authors reported that observational approach is acceptable if patient is asymptomatic like our case [,. ]\\nChoices of approaches should be determined depending on sizes and locations of hernias; either laparoscopic approach with three steps method () combining with lateral decubitus position [] via umbilical incision using mono fire grasping forceps®(Olympus Co., Tokyo Japan) () [] , direct approach via posterolateral Thoracotomy adding rib spreader () [] combined with partial epidural anesthesia using epidural catheter®(Portex Ltd., Hythe UK) () [][] etc.\\nWe chose lateral Thoracotomy via seventh intercostal space adding partial epidural anesthesia using epidural catheter because this retroperitonealfat pad sized large enough may include inclusion organ which need thorough adhesiolysis etc..

Seven years after surgery lymph node recurrence was detected at the splenic hilum and was treated with four courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. Treatment resulted in complete response. However, lymph node metastasis was detected again at the pancreatic tail and splenic hilum at 1 year later (Fig. ). Chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil; 50 Gy in 28 fractions) resulted in complete response at the lymph nodes. Eleven years after surgery computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic solid tumour at the pancreatic tail that appeared to invade the artery of the gastric tube that had been reconstructed during oesophagectomy (Fig. a–c). Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymphadenectomy were performed to treat the tumour that had a diameter of 30 mm and had no connection to the primary tumour site in the oesophagus. The tumour consisted mainly of solid components with poorly defined margins surrounded by nonpancreatic tissues including adipose tissue, fibrosis and inflammatory adhesion (Figs. and ). Pathological examination revealed that the tumour was a squamous cell carcinoma which was compatible with detection of previous OSCC; small amount of viable cancer cells were identified at the main lesion as well as along the margin where nonpancreatic tissues existed. The final diagnosis was PM from OSCC (pathological T0NxM1 stage I; UICC TNM classification). The patient tolerated this operation well and was discharged without any complications. She has continued close follow up without additional treatment and has done well without evidence of recurrence for two years following surgical treatment of PM.\\nIt is very rare for patients with PM from primary breast cancer [–] or from primary lung cancer [,] to develop distant metastases after resection of PM. In cases of PM from primary melanoma [,] or renal cell carcinoma [], almost all patients develop distant metastases after resection of PM.. These findings suggest that surgical treatment might prolong survival time in selected patients with PM from OSCC..\\nThe most common sites for metachronous or synchronous PM from OSCC arethe stomach [] followed by small bowel [] then colon []. Rarely have pancreatico duodenal papilla [] liver [] kidney [] prostate [] thyroid gland [], duodenum [], gallbladder [], lung [], retroperitoneal space [,,]and spine been reported as sites for metachronous or synchronousPMfromOSCC.\\nsurgicaltreattmentofPMfromOSCChasbeenreportedinpatientswithmetachronousPMfromOSCCTOthestomach[,,],smallbowel[],colon[]andrenalcellcarcinoma[].HowevertherearenocasesreportsaboutsurgicaltreattmentofPMfromOSCCitselfbecauseallcasesdevelopeddistantmetastasesafterresectionsofPM.[,,]HerewepresentasinglecaseofsurgicallytreatedpatientwithPMfromOSCCHersurvivedforlongtimeafterremovalsOfMP.\\nInthiscase report we presented an extremely rare case whereby surgical treatment provided long term survival for patient with isolated PM from OSCGiventhatallcasesdevelopeddistantmetastasesafterresectionsOfMP.[,,]Thereareno established guidelines regarding selection criteria for resection therapy for patients with isolated MP From OSCGiventhatsomepatientsdevelopdistantmetastasisafternotlongtimeafterresectionoftheMP.[,,]\\nRiskfactorsforthedevelopmentoffamilialpancreaticcancerincludegender(female),olderage(≥65yearold),AfricanAmericanrace/ethnicity,[,]priorgastrictuberdisease,[,]priorcholecystectomys,[,]useofnonsteroidalantiinflammatorydrugs([NSAIDS])[, ]smoking([],[,]),drinking([],[,]),diabetes mellitus ([],[])andpancreatitis([],[]).ThesefindingsuggestedthatthereareriskfactorsfortheinvolvementoftheexocrinepancreasinthesepatientswhohadisolatedMPFromOSCGiventhatsomepatientsdieinnondeterminedintervalsinbetweentheresultsofserialfollowupCTscansafternotlongtimeafterresectionoftheMP.[,\\nTheriskfactorsfortheinvolvementoftheendocrinerancetotheisletscellsinthesematernalinstancesaregender(male),olderage(≥40yearold),familyhistoryofdiabetesmellitus[(DM)]inthefirstdegree relatives,(DMonsetbeforeaged25yearold),(DMonsetduringteens),(DMonsetduringtwenties),(autoimmunemediateddiabetessusceptibility[(AS)47][AS]ORAS13[];proteinauria[(PRA);proteinauriascreeningevery3monthsfortherst3yearsaftertransplantation;screeningfordiabeticneuropathyusingannualmon\n",

      "1: A 70-year-old nonverbal female presented to the emergency department (ED) from home with her daughter who had noted that the patient has been acutely grimacing in pain from even the lightest palpation over her right flank. She had decreased urine output for the prior two days and her family had noticed an enlargement on the right side of her back one day prior to her ED visit. Of note, the patient presented with poor functional status, was totally bedridden, and was on no antibiotics. She also had a renal flow scan several months prior to her presentation, which revealed the absence of blood flow to the left kidney. A nephrectomy was ultimately rejected based on her medical history and current health status. The patient's medical history was significant for CVA with left hemiparesis, sacral stage 4 pressure ulcers, DM, HLD, failure to thrive, and asthma. Her past surgical history included a left double J-stent placement, an appendectomy, and a tracheostomy that was reversed.\\nOn physical examination, she appeared to be in mild distress with a blood pressure of 93/50, heart rate of 116, respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen saturation of 97% on room air,. She was very cachectic weighing less than 50 lbs with poor functional status; she was nonverbal and unable to respond to questions or communicate pain or discomfort: Her skin appeared dry with a WHO (World Health Organization) scale severity score of 3 over her sacrum and bilaterally overher medial elbows. Abdominal examination was remarkable for tenderness to palpation in the right flank without rebound or guarding and absence of bowel sounds. A firm mass could be felt extending from underneath her right ribcage down into this abdomen.\\nImportant laboratory results included leukocytosis of 18.6 (WBC 12.3), hypogammaglobulinemia with hemoglobin of 7.4 (ref >12 g/dl), hematocrit of 23% (ref >38%), platelets countofof254(ref: )xiii6 , prothrombin time(PT)of15(ref: ), prothrombin time ratio(PTR)of1(ref : ), partial thromboplastin time(PTT)offices’rangeand electrolyteswithin normal limits except for hypocalcemia Ca=7 (Ref : ).>90%oftheleukocytosiswere neutrophils..\\nThe patient’s creatinine at this time was moderately elevated at 2mg/dL but she had been recently admitted with similar creatinine levels two months prior; during that admission she developed fluid retention symptoms and was diagnosed with CHF by cardiac echo which showed an ejection fraction (EF)ofanewyorkheartassociationclassIII.( NYHA III).\\nIntheEDshewastreatedwithintravenouspharmaconfor analgesiaandplacedonamagneticresonanceimaging(MRI)protocolforaclottedJstentorfailuretodrain.: This MRI revealed “a large amount offree fluid collection adjacenttothefailingrightkidneycontainingabroadastrocysticabscess extendingfromtherightcostovertebralyleveltofthepelvisdownintothesacroiliacjoint”.Figure showscreatinfamilyhistoryandsocialhistory.)\\nCTscanrevealedatranslumbarincisionappearanceoftheleftsideoftheabdomenwithamassonthe rightsidecontainingacoatedegenerativeappearingkidneywithcalcificationsandaposteriorrightflankcollectioncontainingairthatextendedbehindthenewspinalcolumntotheelderlyfemoralhead.” Figure showsphysicalexaminationfindings.)An IVwasplacedandantibioticshavebeeninitiatedcovering Gram positive/negative/anaerobic organisms as well as doxycycline were added due to concern for Rocky Mountain spotted fever based on exposure history obtained from family members present at bedside.\\nInterventions:\\ntreatmentincludedemergentIRURDuringwhichaseptickwasfoundintheinfectedcollectionaswellasremoval oft he infected collect ion , insertion oft he drainage catheter intotheabdominal cavitytodecompress t he abscessandeffusethewoundtoslowtherateofthebacterialgrowthandslowtherateo fproductionoffoul smelling pus .

He was last known normal when he left his home that morning and was wearing an Aspen collar. He had no neurologic deficits with a GCS of 15. Routine ECG and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable except for an elevated serum alcohol level.\\nA full cervical spine computed tomography (CT) scan was performed which demonstrated an Anderson and Montesano classification type III left occipital condyle fracture as well as Levine and Edwards classification type III (Jefferson) fracture with mild lateral subluxation of bilateral C1 masses []. An asymmetric widening and slight anterior subluxation of the right AOJ was also noted []. The patient was transferred to a level I trauma center for further management.\\nIn the emergency department, he reported severe midline neck pain, worse with movement, and unchanged paresthesia to bilateral upper extremities which he said is his baseline. Physical exam revealed a right forehead hematoma with overlying abrasions and tenderness to palpation over the midline posterior neck. He exhibited full strength and unchanged baseline sensation to all extremities. The patient denied bowel or bladder incontinence; he had strong rectal tone, intact perianal sensation.\\nDuring his clinical course, he became increasingly altered/agitated refractory to medication; unable to maintain spinal precautions due to agitation required endotracheal intubation for protection of cervical spine; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine demonstrated ligamentous injury at craniocervical junction [], asymmetric left odontoid-lateral mass widening [], widening/subluxation of right AOJ [], edema of paravertebral soft tissues around fracture site extending into craniocervinal junction []; T2 sagittail view [] showed edema involving C2 nerve root sleeve extending into paravertebral soft tissues at C2 level.\\nThe patient underwent occiput–C2 posterior instrumented fusion using laterally contoured rods secured by three pedicle screws at each Occiput S2 binomial osteosynthesis system (Stryker Neurovascular), two pedicle screws at each C3–C5 levels bilaterally using Moss Miami screw set (Stryker Neurovascular). Intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed appropriate hardware placement [Figures –].\\nPostoperatively, the patient remained intubated due to airway edema from acute pharyngitis complicated by aspiration pneumonia requiring broad spectrum antibiotics therapy; postoperative CT scan showed stable occipitocervival construct without evidence oscallopophy or hardware failure [].

She also felt more tired and had lost about three kilos in weight in the past month. She denied any history of tuberculosis exposure or smoking.\\nPhysical examination showed that she had swollen bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes, which were approximately 1 cm in diameter. Chest enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed over 200 uniform size pulmonary nodules in an evenly dispersed pattern at bilateral lungs (). A 38×45mm new creature was found at the dorsal segment of lower lobe of left lung (). Small amount of left-sided pleural and pericardial effusion was also found ().\\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) system was used to assist diagnosis, but it only identified 18 pulmonary nodules, which is lower than 10% of the real data. All nodules identified by AI were judged as low-risk.\\nOther enhanced CT scans showed multiple liver and adrenal metastases (); multiple bone metastases (); as well as apparent lymphadenopathy in left hilar, bilateral mediastinal () and retroperitoneal area (-). Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple osteolytic bone destruction in thoracic vertebrae () and T7 vertebral body compression fracture (-).\\nThe T-SPOT test was negative while there was a significant elevation of [unspecified] immunoglobulin E level.\\nThe patient refused to undergo biopsy from the beginning. Pathological results from fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed that there were no malignant cells on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology; however, pathological examination on biopsy tissue showed small cell lung cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation (-C,-D).\\nAfter anti-infection treatment for one week, the patient’s symptoms improved significantly without fever or other discomforts such as coughing or sputum production during this period.\\nHowever, due to her poor compliance with chemotherapy regimen recommended by doctors after two cycles of chemotherapy using carboplatin plus etoposide combined with avastin; she eventually died four months after being discharged from our hospital despite receiving local radiotherapy treatment at local hospitals afterwards.\\nThis case report has been approved by Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board of The First Affiliated Hospital College Of Medicine Zhejiang University Medical School., Written informed consent for publication could not be obtained because : .

      "1: Mr AB, a 30-year-old male was involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident. He sustained multiple injuries including a frontal open comminuted depressed skull fracture with a fragment displaced and abutting the superior sagittal sinus. The fracture line involved the right medial orbital wall extending through the ethmoid air cells and roof of the right sphenoid sinus. Other cranial injuries included a fracture through the right side of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, frontal intraparenchymal contusions and traumatic subarachnoid/subdural haematoma. He also had an extensive facial laceration extending across the left side of his forehead to medial canthus, proptosis of his right eye, closed unstable pelvic fracture with involvement of left superior gluteal artery and subcapsular liver haematoma.\\nHe was intubated by paramedical officers and admitted to State Major Trauma Unit (SMTU) where he was managed in intensive care unit (ICU). The decision was made to medically manage his intracranial pressures for 7 days prior to surgically treating his skull fractures with intracranial pressure monitoring. On Day 1 post admission he underwent a right lateral canthotomy, approximation of forehead laceration and application of pelvic binder.\\nOn Day 3 he was noted to have clear low flow discharge from his right medial canthus with beta trace protein level (BTP) at 11.0 mg/l confirming CSF leak.

      "1: A 36-year-old woman was admitted to our department for the insertion of a PICC on her right arm. She suffered extensive burns of more than 90% total body surface area in a house fire 2 years earlier, which resulted in severe contracture formation throughout her body. She had undergone many reconstructive procedures and had received numerous skin grafts over the past 2 years. On physical exam, we found that most of her skin was hard contracted skin. On inspection, no peripheral veins were evident. We found accessible veins using a linear probe ultrasound device (6–15 MHz, SonoSite Edge, FUJIFILM SonoSite, Inc., Washington, USA) on the following parts of her chest and arm: the subclavian and axillary veins on the anterior chest; and the brachial vein (at approximately 3 cm distal from the superior border of the insertion point of the right deltoid muscle) of her right arm (). We chose to use the right brachial vein as an alternative access site to avoid possible complications resulting from using either the subclavian or axillary vein such as accidental arterial puncture or hemothorax. The right brachial vein measured 3 mm by ultrasound imaging.\\nHer right arm had restricted motion range due to extensive contractures. Therefore, we positioned her in the right semilateral position so that we could gain easy access to medial side of this arm by supination and abduction (). The skin of this arm was prepped with 1% chlorhexidine alcohol solution and covered with a sterile drape. The ultrasound probe was covered with a sterile plastic probe cover. The indwelling catheter was inserted using sterile barrier precautions and local anesthetic (5 mL of 1% lidocaine). A small incision (approximately <0.5 cm) was made at any point along what appeared to be a single venous channel on ultrasound imaging; however, in some cases where there were multiple channels on ultrasound imaging, several small incisions were made at locations where venous channels were observed by ultrasound guidance so that these channels could be identified after making these incisions (). After identifying blood pooling within this incision site directly underneath skin without visible tissue damage or nerve injury while observing from above with ultrasound imaging ()), we inserted a 20G catheter-over-the needle (48 mm) forward toward its intended location—the brachial vein—while avoiding accidental arterial puncture ()). After confirming that there was no blood return during aspiration from around the inserted needle tip while holding back skin with our nondominant hand's fingertips via sonographic visualization only without any external stabilization such as tape or tourniquet usage during this procedure due to its low invasiveness; ), we cut all but approximately <1 cm portions of both catheter & needle after verifying once again that there was no blood return during aspiration from around their junction via sonographic visualization only before gently pulling out these components together so that any minor residual blood remaining inside this tract would drain easily into an empty central venous catheter which had been placed previously via another peripheral venous access point; ). Following successful insertion/removal procedure for CVCR via USG guidance alone without additional external stabilization such as tape or tourniquet usage due to its low invasiveness; ), we rechecked whether brachialveinwas patent or not by injecting saline via justinserted CVCR outsideofultrasonguage observation untilwe confirmedthattherewasnobloodreturnduringaspirationfromarounditsjunctionvia still further sonographic visualization before connecting it to an intravenous infusion set while maintain ingskinfold compressioontoinsertionpointwithtwo piecesofsterile gauze bandages until placementofCVCRwascompleted successfully at approximately <5 min after initial incision (); ).\\nAfter placement offurthercentralvenoussaccessdevicefortoprovidechemotherapyvia hisright internal jugularveinunderultrasonguidedefiningusinga shortbevel(20G)needleandthenadvancingitforwardundercontinuousevaluationvia realtimeultrasonguided techniqueas previouslydescribed [] ()),weattemptedtoidentifypotentialbrachiocephalicveinand/orthejugularveintouseasa potentialsiteforinsertionofapositivepressureventilationcatheter(PPVC);however,,dueitoptimalpositioningtubeclampforPPVandconvenientconnectiontophotopumpafterplacingoffurthercentralvenoussaccessdevicesfortoprovidechemotherapyviahisrightsubclavianveinandrightaxillaryveindueitoptimalpositioningofthearmundergoingcontracturemanagementsurgeryaswellasthepossibilityoftheuseofthebrachiocephalicveinaorticcannulectomyandsynovectomyfordesiredorthopedicreconstructiveproceduresifnecessaryafterfullassessmentbysonographyandvisual inspectionoftheinternalanatomicalstructureofthepatient’sdeterminedbycombineduseofultrasonguidedefining[]andrightexamination underlocalanesthesia],wefinallydecidedtouseanotherareaonhisrightarmnearthelateralborderbetweentheadductandpectoralismajormusclesasapositivepressureventilationcathether sitebecauseitallowedusnotonlytoeasilyattachatubeclampneartheneckbutalsoenabledusnotonlytoeasilymonitorrespiratorystatusbutalsotocheckpulmonarycomplianceaftercommencingppvvisuallythroughfacialskinandauscultationover thenose&mouthafterfullassessmentby\n",

      "1: A 59-year-old nulligravid female presented to clinic with symptoms of urinary urgency incontinence. She had a past medical history of endometriosis, autoimmune hepatitis, cirrhosis, and denied any pertinent mental/psychological history or trauma. Her initial symptoms included urgency, voiding up to 5 times an hour, and nocturia up to five times per night. She had no previous vaginal surgeries. Baseline sexual function evaluation was completed at intake with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire where the arousal domain equaled 0.9 (range 0-6, with 6 indicating maximal arousal) (). Pelvic examination was significant for vaginal atrophy but no notable clitoral or labial abnormalities were visualized. There were no signs of prolapse or pelvic floor musculature hypertonicity. She was asked to keep a voiding diary and then advised to attempt timed voiding upon its completion. She was also started on vaginal estrogen and a generic anticholinergic agent (oxybutynin 10 XL daily). After 4 weeks of treatment, she experienced significant worsening of anticholinergic side-effects and stopped the medication on her own. She was then started on a beta sympathomimetic (mirabegron 25mg daily). After six weeks of this therapy, she did not have any subjective improvement in her symptoms.\\nThe patient was counseled on third tier treatment options and ultimately decided to proceed with SNM. Placement of the sacral neuromodulator was done per manufacturer instructions after testing showed adequate sensory response in the S3 sacral foramina during stimulation at multiple levels along the sacral nerve root above the motor level as well as absence of motor response at the lower extremity when stimulating at the S3 level.\\nAt one-week follow-up, her incisional pain was minimal; she did not require oral analgesics and had reported marked improvement in urinary symptoms consistent with test phase.\\nHowever, near the six month follow up appointment, she expressed concerns about persistent arousal symptoms in the vaginal area overall with new onset hypersensitivity localized to the clitoris. She did not have these symptoms prior to or immediately postimplant nor during the trial phase before implantation.\\nPelvic examination by a female provider demonstrated an enlarged clitoris that became hard upon digital stimulation () and increased vagular engorgement compared to postmenopausal changes noted at implantation..\\nSNM system was interrogated and found to be functioning properly with good impedance levels.\\nShe was given counseling around behavioral modifications including loose clothing which resulted in resolution of arousability however she continued to experience vaginal engorgement and dyspareunia.\\nFurther sexual function evaluation using FSFI revealed an arousal domain score of zero indicating absent genital sensation during attempted sexual activity which is distinct from her baseline score prior to SNM implantation (\\n).\\nAt this time, we discussed potential surgical solutions such as clitoridectomy or partial clitoridectomy but our patient refused any surgical intervention stating that it would negate any sexual desire that she currently has despite potential relief of her urinary symptoms. Her arousal complaints continued for approximately one year since placement when she eventually requested removal ofthe generator alone without lead revision.\\nSince generator removal there has been complete resolutionofarousalgivesubsequenttogeneratorrevision<EOD> .\n",

She was transferred to our medical hospital for bacterial endophthalmitis in her right eye. Her mental state was elated, labile mood, irritability, disinhibition, and grandiose delusions of being a beauty pageant contestant. Her mental state affected her insight into and compliance with all medical treatment; as such she was mentally and medically unwell.\\nHer bipolar disorder was previously stabilized on dual mood stabilizers (lithium carbonate and sodium valproate). Since her medical comorbidities were diagnosed in 2010 including CKD approaching ESKD secondary to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II (DM), hypertension requiring four antihypertensives including a beta blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and calcium channel blocker (CCB), hyperlipidemia requiring rosuvastatin as well as obstructive sleep apnea requiring continuous positive airway pressure machine at home; lithium was ceased due to CKD. She switched to antipsychotics including sulpiride then risperidone while continuing sodium valproate.\\nShe had multiple relapses since then necessitating three admissions between 2011–2014 for mania. Despite inpatient treatments her condition were not stabilized. She was trialed on intramuscular antipsychotics zuclopenthixol due to poor compliance with oral medications.\\nShe first presented to our medical hospital for 5 months complicated by five intensive care unit admissions due to decompensated type 2 respiratory failure from January till July 2016 before transferring back over to the psychiatric ward.\\nAlthough there were initial improvements in her mental state with sodium valproate plus risperidone she developed bicytopenia on sodium valproate; she had repeated episodes of drowsiness prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) as well as bradycardia likely secondary to antipsychotics.\\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) considered but deemed patient is high general anesthetic risk given recent respiratory failure history; permanent pacemaker implanted after diagnosis sick sinus syndrome by cardiologist during this admission period.\\nIn August 2016 she developed acute kidney injury secondary hypoperfusion renal failure from worsening DM control evidenced by HbA1c =9% which required hemodialysis twice weekly at the interim before returning back into stable euglycemic range post dietary modifications/insulin therapy thereafter.\\nIn October of same year following an episode whereby she smashed up windows using metal bars at home because “I am Beyonce” indicating grandiose delusion again together with agitation/aggression towards staff during routine observations that required chemical restraints via intramuscular haloperidol it became clear that we need alternative treatment options given limited choices due medication intolerances/toxicities\\nAfter discussion within multidisciplinary team we decided on lurasidone based on its safety profile regarding metabolic effects weight gain or QTc prolongation[] yet effective against acute mania[]–[] plus it can be safely coadministered with hemodialysis without drug accumulation concerns.[]\\nStarting dose lurasidone is based on previous antipsychotic use: initially titrated up from risperidone's target dose of 4 mg daily over one week cross taper\n",

      "1: A 60-year-old female patient was first diagnosed with urethra adenocarcinoma 8 years ago. Total resection of the urinary bladder with lymphatic dissection was performed and then combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy were applied. In the following year, a reoperation for metastasis of the urethral adenocarcinoma and vulvectomy with left inguinal radical lymph node dissection were performed. Pathology was in compliance with the first report of the urethral adenocarcinoma.\\nAfter operation, 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy was applied to her pelvic region. Two years later she suffered a mass in her right thigh that caused a suspicion of another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy was performed and pathology specimens revealed malignant mesenchymal tumor (Figure ). Then, 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy were applied to her right thigh lesion followed by wide resection of the tumor (Figure ). Pathology report showed high grade pleomorphic sarcoma (Figure ). Oncology consultation recommended no postoperative chemotherapy but they applied 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy.\\nThe patient had been regularly followed for next three years during which no evidence of local or systemic relapse was present; however she quit routine control examinations afterwards.\\nFour months ago she noticed a mass in her left thigh that caused an MRI evaluation (Figures , , ) for this new lesion which showed subcutaneous lesion in left thigh having typical features of lipoma on MRI evaluation; tru-cut biopsy reported low grade periosteal chondral tumor on pathological examination. PET scan showed apical lesion of right lung which thought to be metastasis at that time.\\nIn our clinic, CT angiographic evaluation revealed soft tissue component enclosing bone lesion medially at least 180 degrees as shown by CT images (Figures , , ) while MRI also demonstrated soft tissue component enclosing bone lesion medially as well as also involving bone segment more than one hundred degrees as shown by MR images (Figures -).\\nBecause there is only one case report about extraskeletal osteochondroma [,] we decided to perform wide resection without preoperative biopsy because it would have been very difficult to differentiate extraskeletal osteochondroma from malignant mesenchymal tumors such as dedifferentiated or high grade pleomorphic sarcomas using tru-cut biopsy alone especially when considering its histopathological features such as permeative growth pattern seen in dedifferentiated or high grade pleomorphic sarcomas are similar to those seen in benign osteochondromas [].\\nWide resection including femur diaphysis together with removal of all involved muscles except gluteus maximus muscle and reconstruction using long stemmed megaprosthesis were performed after neurovascular structures were secured during surgery.\\nPathologic examination reported low grade periosteal chondromatosis involving almost whole circumference around femur diaphysis associated with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from skin overlying this mass located distally approximately ten centimeters away from primary tumoral site located at proximal part associated with vascular invasion but without perineural invasion; there is no evidence for malignancy within osseous tissue removed during surgery while skin overlying this mass underwent free margin excision due to involvement by carcinoma arising from it so we considered it dermal matrical origin instead because dermal matrical origin has better prognosis than other types like eccrine sweat gland origin [].\\nthe patient recovered uneventfully after surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting if doxorubicin plus ifosfamide regimen due to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from skin overlying extraskeletel osteochondroma while she refused radiation therapy because she had already received enough amount previously due to previous history showing multiple recurrences despite postoperative radiotherapies given after each operation so far; now\n",

      "6: months after the initial surgery, a 15-year-old male presented to the clinic with right knee pain that started after a sports activity. The pain was piercing and sharp in nature, with severity of 3 out of 10. He had undergone 6 months of physical therapy without relief of symptoms. He then underwent diagnostic arthroscopy, partial medial meniscectomy, chondroplasty of trochlea, and partial synovectomy. No complications were encountered during surgery as bleeding was controlled by tourniquet. Postoperative therapy consisted of a home exercise program and formal strengthening therapy began on postoperative day 10.\\nOn postoperative day 17 he experienced a knee effusion, decreased range of motion (ROM), and inability to flex his quadriceps muscle. On physical exam in the clinic there was mild effusion of the right knee with no ecchymosis; laxity tests and meniscal exams were negative; ROM was 2 degrees extension/110 degrees flexion; and a knee aspiration revealed withdrawal of 62 mL serosanguinous fluid (Figure ). The patient had been taking aspirin but discontinuation its use was instructed.\\nThe patient was instructed to stop physical therapy, rest his knee, use ice for 20 minutes three to four times per day for several days until his next office visit in two weeks at which time blood work would be obtained (Figure ). Blood test results showed normal complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), INR/PTT.\\nOver the next several weeks he experienced recurrent effusions with related symptoms requiring three additional joint aspirations.\\nTen weeks after initial surgery he underwent second arthroscopy during which hematoma removal and synovectomy were performed routinely without intraoperative complications but continued bleeding from sutured incisions occurred postoperatively requiring admission for observation by hematologist consultation. The patient denied previous bleeding problems but Platelet aggregation tests revealed decreased platelet aggregation/secretion with arachidonic acid (AA), collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) agonists consistent with platelet dysfunction or defects secondary to antiplatelet medications such as aspirin.\\nThe decision at this point is whether or not to proceed further with TKA given that this is an uncommon presentation associated with possible increased risk for perioperative hemorrhage due to platelet dysfunction versus continuing conservative management including repeated joint aspiration if symptoms persist over time.\\nAt age sixteen years one year following first arthroscopy he continued experiencing persistent swelling associated pain limiting ROM from five degrees extension/95 degree flexion despite multiple joint aspirations over two years since first presentation resulting in approximately one liter total volume removed over time along with significant medical costs associated therewith including multiple office visits plus hospital admissions plus laboratory testing plus radiology studies including MRI's along with orthopedic surgeon fees plus anesthesia fees all adding up significantly over time so it seemed reasonable at this point that TKA should be considered versus continuing conservative management especially since it had been shown recently that outcomes are similar between early vs delayed TKA [].\\nHe therefore elected conversion from hemiepiphysiodesis hardware into TKA using computer assisted navigation due primarily because we have found previously [] that navigation provides superior component alignment leading ultimately presumably to superior long term implant survivorship compared non-navigation cases where malalignment is commoner especially when done by less experienced surgeons who do not routinely use navigation [].\\nIntraoperatively there were extensive scars throughout both compartments making exposure difficult but once achieved it appeared as though previous chondroplasty had been performed on lateral femoral condyle extending into intercondylar notch so only medial compartment needed addressed so femoral component removed downward through previous incision downward through patella until tibial tuberosity could be seen then cut downward removing remaining distal femur followed by tibia then patella cuts made using standard technique via intramedullary pins inserted into both tibia & femur guided by computer assisted navigation system using Stryker Navigation System™ version ION™ software version NAVIGATION SYSTEMS FOR KNEE ARTHROPLASTY® release notes revision B dated July , .\\nAfter cutting blocks made components trialed then cemented stems & components cemented using standard technique followed by trial reduction showing good balance side-to-side followed by soft tissue balancing aiming for symmetric quadriceps contraction while viewing both compartments simultaneously looking for any apparent asymmetry confirming symmetric tightness on both sides while viewing both sides simultaneously looking also\n",

      "19: year old, African American, healthy female presented for surgical evaluation of a hepatic mass. She reported approximately 18 months of occasional and intermittent episodes of epigastric discomfort. More recently, she had developed symptoms of early satiety and anorexia.\\nOn physical exam she had vague diffuse upper abdominal tenderness and a firm palpable mass in the left upper quadrant extending to the midline. A calcified left upper quadrant mass was seen on abdominal X-ray taken during an emergency room visit (). Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for moderate elevations of alkaline phosphatase (207 U/L) and alpha fetoprotein (6.8 ng/mL). To further evaluate the mass, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed demonstrating a large heterogeneous mass occupying the left lobe of the liver with a 5-cm area of calcification in the anterior aspect (). MRI demonstrated a single heterogeneously enhancing 15 × 10 × 13.8 cm lobulated mass inseparable from the left lobe of the liver (Figure ). The left portal vein was not visualized and there was no biliary dilatation. T1-and T2-weighted sequences showed a 5-cm area of signal hypointensity with multiple hypointense nonenhancing linear areas throughout the mass consistent with areas of calcification (Figure ). A small amount intraperitoneal free fluid was present. Staging chest and brain CT demonstrated no evidence for metastatic disease while whole body Tc-99m MDP bone scan demonstrated no evidence o skeletal metastatic disease.\\nThe radiologic differential diagnosis included sarcoma including metastatic osteosarcoma as well as fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.\\nAt operation, large scarred lesion replacing entire left hepatic lobe immediately identified extending across falciform ligament into segment four; it also adherent to but did not invade stomach; abdominal cavity examined revealed no metastatic deposits noted; right hepatic lobe examined with both palpation as well as intraoperative ultrasound free tumor.\\nLeft hepatic lobectomy performed without complication or blood loss; patient recovered uneventfully postoperatively.\\nFinal pathology confirmed diagnosis o fibrolamellar HCC without evidence microscopic invasion into adjacent parenchyma or vasculature grossly or microscopically although focally close parenchymal relationship noted at resection margin on cut surface specimen grossly (); histologically this represented an unencapsulated neoplasm composed predominantly solid nests sheets glandular epithelium set within prominent fibrous stroma containing dense collagen bundles hyalinized vessels () Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity Hepar-1 () AFP () Glypican3 () CKpan negative expression by immunohistochemistry final pathologic diagnosis fibrolamellar HCC confirmed\\nPostoperatively patient recovered uneventfully from surgery discharged home on postoperative day five tolerating regular diet without dyspeptic symptoms underwent routine follow up care at our institution by time developed recurrent disease six months after resection initially presenting with headache underwent brain imaging revealing solitary cerebral lesion resected pathology confirmed metastasis FLHCC recurrence treated definitively using stereotactic radiosurgery single treatment dose delivered to cranial lesion fifty grays resulting complete resolution neurologic symptoms remained free from systemic recurrence until twelve months after initial resection when she again developed dyspeptic symptoms undergoing endoscopy biopsy confirming recurrent FLHCC treated definitively using oxaliplatin based chemotherapy regimen FOLFOX currently remains alive one year after development first systemic disease recurrence followed up regularly at our institution until time preparing manuscript currently stable without evidence local regional or systemic disease continues to be offered participation clinical trials available locally\n",

      "1: A 50-year-old gentleman presented to the Emergency Eye Casualty Department having been brought in by paramedics. The patient was in pain and had bleeding from his left eye. There was limited history available as the patient was found at home with the above complaints. Further history revealed that he had been assaulted two years ago, following which his left eye had poor sight.\\nOur patient had lens dislocation, anatomical dysregulation, vitreous prolapse and traumatic uveitis of the left eye. He perceived only light in his left eye. His right eye demonstrated excellent baseline visual acuity of 6/6.\\nThe patient did not attend any follow up appointments after the assault and subsequently got lost in our system.\\nHe has a past medical history of paranoid schizophrenia and substance misuse involving methadone use. He is currently living in sheltered accommodation with good engagement with his support services.\\nOn examination there was extrusion of ocular contents through a 3 mm central circular corneal perforation (Figure ) in the left eye which was bleeding actively (Figure ). Our patient appeared distressed due to pain despite appropriate analgesia.\\nDifferential diagnoses at this stage included perforation of a corneal ulcer, trauma and ocular malignancy.\\nThe gentleman was euthymic in mood, demonstrated good understanding of care plan during examination under anaesthesia (EUA) and deemed to have capacity to make decisions as he articulated clearly what he wanted from us; namely for us to stem bleeding from his eyes so that he could get better. We discussed with him our concerns regarding further deterioration if we proceeded with EUA but agreed on proceeding as it would facilitate further management planning given his psychiatric comorbidities we felt it prudent to ensure that he would be able to communicate effectively what we should do for him given that decision making capacity can be impaired by psychosis or sedative medications used during EUA [].\\nWe proceeded with EUA under local anaesthetic using one drop Proparacaine® (Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV). Our initial differential diagnosis based on clinical findings included spontaneous rupture of globe secondary to ocular malignancy or infective process such as fungal keratitis [].\\nOur initial steps were meticulous irrigation and debridement using BCL® (Bausch & Lomb Incorporated) bandage contact lens followed by copious irrigation using BSS® (Alcon Laboratories Inc.) balanced salt solution while ensuring sterility using iodine painted swab over entry site into orbit followed by placement of JJ stent into anterior chamber via syringe aspiration technique under strict aseptic conditions while ensuring full gowning up including face masks for both operator and assistant along with theatre staff present throughout procedure due to risk factors involved [].\\nFollowing this step we proceeded towards repair phase whereby conjunctiva were everted using moistened cotton tips revealing healthy sclera beneath which appeared pink without any signs suggestive infective pathology such as necrosis or induration []. Sutures were placed using absorbable polyglactin suture material 6-0 size followed by meticulous closure over tenons capsule taking care not breach conjunctival epithelium whilst ensuring adequate apposition between conjunctiva tissue edges prior securing them together utilising interrupted sutures fashioned out from same polyglactin material used previously [].\\nAfter completion all efforts were directed towards achieving best possible cosmesis utilising skin adhesive film Tegaderm™(3M Health Care Ltd) along wound margins whilst placing dressings consisting BPCS®(Mavala Inc.) onto entire surgical site leaving no exposed wound edges whatsoever thus achieving optimal cosmetic outcome while minimizing risk for potential post operative complications such as superficial necrosis [] following surgery itself [,-] thereby reducing overall risk for subsequent microbial invasion [] within otherwise immunocompromised host population groups [-] like our current case study herein described herewith below;\\nadequate preoperative antibiotic cover via intravenous co-amoxyclav given one hour preoperatively continued intraoperatively throughout procedure duration until conversion back onto oral form via tablet formulation once extubated post op; adequate post operative analgesia via intramuscular co-codon combined analgesic administered immediately upon completion operation continuing over next six hours via subcutaneous route thereafter converted onto oral form administered twice daily over next five days; tight glucose control achieved intraoperatively maintaining blood glucose levels between 4–7mmol/L achieved through continuous monitoring utilising point care testing device alongside regular monitoring vital signs including capillary blood glucose levels throughout perioperative period []; maintenance fluid replacement therapy delivered intraoperatively achieving total volume replacement therapy guided primarily by central venous pressure measurements alongside regular assessment vital signs including urine output whilst avoiding hypotension altogether []; maintenance oxygen supplementation delivered intraoperatively aiming achieve partial oxygen pressure levels >10 kPa throughout peri operative period []; maintenance fluid replacement therapy delivered post operatively guided primarily by regular assessment vital signs alongside urine output whilst avoiding hypotension altogether again;\\ntight glycaemic control maintained post op maintain blood glucose levels between 4–7mmol/L achieved through continuous monitoring utilising point care testing device alongside regular monitoring vital sign including capillary blood glucose levels throughout peri operative period []; maintenance oxygen supplementation maintained aim achieve partial oxygen pressure >10 kPa throughout peri operative period again;\\ntight antipsychotic coverage maintained during admission maintain therapeutic serum level olanzapine target range between 25–50 ng/ml achieved through administration intramuscular depot preparations olanzapine commenced day before operation continuously monitor serum drug level upon conversion back onto table\n",

      "1: A 50-year-old male with a history of trauma leading to spinal cord injury at the T6 level, resulting in paraplegia, and a thoracic arteriovenous malformation requiring surgery for both conditions presented to our gastroenterology office with complaints of copious rectal discharge. The patient estimated that he was losing approximately one liter per day. He reported that the fluid had been purulent and malodorous over the past few months but had not noticed any changes in color or consistency.\\nThe patient's medical history was also significant for a left ischial ulcer and subsequent sacral decubitus ulcer following his initial surgery which required multiple debridements and prolonged course of antibiotics. Three years later, he developed another ischial wound with fevers which were treated by incision and drainage as well as an additional course of antibiotics.\\nHe then presented with new onset copious rectal discharge. He reported no other symptoms to his primary care physician or any other specialist over the previous several years despite having access to healthcare through his employer. He did mention minor mucus drainage from his anus about once every three weeks but this had not changed recently nor was it associated with any other symptoms or signs suggesting an active urinary tract or genital infection.\\nHis past surgical history was also significant for placement of a sigmoid end-colostomy due to chronic constipation.\\nThe patient denied any changes within his colostomy pouch or any other symptoms related to it. His physical examination was notable for paraplegia, flexion contracture of bilateral knees, and well-pouched colostomy in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen (). The rectal examination was notable for normal appearing anus with some minor residual hemorrhoidal skin tags as well as obvious atrophy of both buttocks (). Digital rectal exam demonstrated very low rectal tone without sensation and large amount purulent discharge ().\\nThe patient returned one week later after failure on conservative management including bowel control suppositories, laxatives, enemas along with intravenous antibiotics given during two separate hospital admissions where he received intravenous fluids resulting in improvement from 1–2 quarts per day output down to 200–300 cc/day output; however; he continued to have intermittent episodes whereby he would have large volume losses upwards towards his baseline loss described above.\\nDue to these findings on physical examination along with continued elevations in white blood cell count despite aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy while hospitalized along with imaging findings suggestive fistulization between distal sigmoid colon/rectum and left ischium seen on computerized tomography scan (), we elected to take him directly back into the operating room without prepping him for surgery from a sterile standpoint so that we could perform a diagnostic laparoscopy followed by digital rectal exploration through anal canal repair if needed based upon our findings during these procedures.\\nIntraoperatively we found no evidence within either bowel wall thickening nor did we see anything suspicious within either mesenteric mass during laparoscopy; however; upon performing digital rectal exploration I noted what appeared like two small fistulas located just proximally within reach from my finger tips at approximately 6 cm from anal verge surrounded by extremely scar tissue making up what appeared like prior hemorrhoid tissue (Figures –).\\nI then performed simple excision/resection around all margins followed by closure via sutured repair using absorbable suture material leaving behind only two transverse full thickness bites which were opened posteriorly via sharp excision allowing us then place drains anteriorly into these defects before finally bringing posterior walls together via interrupted suturing using nonabsorbable suture material thereby achieving good apposition between all edges involved while ensuring adequate hemostasis throughout all repaired areas (Figures –).\\nWe then placed protective silicon drains anteriorly before finally bringing posterior walls together via interrupted suturing using nonabsorbable suture material thereby achieving good apposition between all edges involved while ensuring adequate hemostasis throughout all repaired areas before finally placing suction drains anteriorly into both wounds before finally bringing skin layers together via interrupted vicryl horizontal mattress stitches leaving behind subcutaneous vicryl sutures allowing us then close skin layers over top after applying local anesthetic cream prior placing final dressing onto this area afterwards (Figures –).\\nPostoperatively this gentleman tolerated procedure without complication went home on postop day number three after being able tolerate regular diet without difficulty having normal bowel function returning shortly after operation ending his longstanding problem involving daily copious feculoscopic discharge previously experienced secondary due likely due developmentally acquired fistulae secondary prolonged history complex medical problems involving spinal cord injury leading ultimately development sacral decubitus\n",

Imaging revealed an acute infarct in the posterior limb of the right internal capsule without hemorrhagic transformation and an acute punctate infarct in the right parietal subcortical white matter with corresponding diffusion restrictions, as well as remote evidence of subcortical chronic diffuse microhemorrhages (). Psychiatric consultation was requested after the patient stated she wanted to “strangle herself” with her oxygen cord. She was evaluated by psychiatry on hospital day 2. The patient reported history of bipolar disorder, but had not been prescribed or taken psychiatric medications for several years. She reported fluctuating mood since her initial stroke, but denied any prior psychiatric care or hospitalizations. During her hospitalization, she did report visual hallucinations and her presentation was felt to be consistent with delirium. She was started on quetiapine 25 mg.\\nFollowing a six-day medical admission during which she continued to exhibit problematic behaviors including repeatedly climbing out of bed, bedding down only to immediately get out of bed again throughout the night, repeated demanding for nicotine patches that were already applied, refusal of medications due to “poisoning” them, and agitation when mobilized from bed that prompted physical restraints; psychiatry was reconsulted for management of behavioral disturbances. The patient interfered with nursing duties and staff safety.\\nIn addition to quetiapine 25 mg at bedtime that had been started by the admitting team, psychiatry team added zolpidem extended release 10 mg due to nighttime awakenings; haloperidol 2 mg multiple times a day due its antipsychotic properties rather than its anticholinergic properties; glycopyrrolate prior to haloperidol administration to reduce antiemetic effects of haloperidol; diphenhydramine due its antipruritic effects rather than its sedative properties; and lorazepam as needed for agitation.

      "1: A 78-year-old man with a history of several laparotomies underwent open drainage and sigmoidectomy because of peritonitis and colon cancer resection. Three years later, he underwent a curative bladder resection for bladder cancer via an extraperitoneal approach. On the third postoperative day, dirty brown discharge was noted in a surgical drainage tube placed in the postbladder space, accompanied by high fever and severe abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography showed fluid collection around a small bowel loop in the pelvis () and in the upper abdomen (). Urgent exploration through a midline incision revealed an injury 5 mm long in the small bowel injury at the base of the pelvis (). Due to presence of severe intestinal adhesions from previous repeated surgeries, it was not possible to perform adequate bowel dissection for enterectomy and anastomosis; therefore we simply closed this injury by layer to layer suture. After this second surgery there was no fever elevation or discharge; thus oral feeding was started 11 days after first surgery.\\nDuring that night sudden elevation in temperature occurred with enteral drainage from midline incision seen. Emergency computed tomography of pelvis showed fluid collection (), so patient prepared for further surgery.\\nDuring operation adhesive bands between intestinal loops were dissected, perforated bowel removed () and intestinal continuity reestablished via end to end anastomosis (). This operation took almost 10 hours with estimated blood loss of 576 ml leading to marked tissue edema.\\nAfter this third operation patient's temperature normalized but his small bowel seen distended on abdominal radiographs (). Contrast examination of bowel showed that passage of contrast medium poor but unclear whether leak present or not ().\\nOn day eight after initial laparotomy patient developed septic shock without any sign indicating leakage from recent ileoileal anastomosis such as peritonitis or enterocutaneous fistula formation. However on day nine he suddenly developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation which could not be restored by cardiopulmonary resuscitation so died on ninth postoperative day despite all efforts made by intensivists including extracorporeal membrane oxygenator insertion during one week period before his death.\\nThe autopsy findings revealed that there were two ileoileal perforations at both proximal () and distal ends () from previous suture line without any evidence showing ischemia as cause for these multiple ileoileal perforations although it is difficult to deny possibility since they are located quite distant from each other compared with length of small intestine; however it is also true that these two points are relatively close compared with length between two suture lines where sutures were taken out indicating some degree of stress had been applied onto those sites due probably either direct mechanical trauma during multiple laparotomies performed over past several years or inflammatory reaction caused by repeated surgeries resulting stricture formation which might have been relieved during last surgery resulting necrosis/perforation when subjected into further stress such as sepsis leading finally into death although we cannot deny possibility that these two points may be coincidentally located just above ligature used during embalming process causing direct damage onto those sites rather than being true points showing perforation.\\nIn addition another interesting finding observed at autopsy was presence free air within portal vein system suggesting free air within venous system itself rather than being derived from gastrointestinal tract since there were no signs indicating gastrointestinal tract's involvement except recent operative site where multiple ileoileal perforations found while other organs including stomach did not show any signs indicating their involvement such as ulceration/perforation/bleeding etc.; however it is still difficult to explain how free air entered into venous system itself since there should be some communication between gut lumen containing free air derived most likely due either obstruction caused by tumor growth/necrosis etc., present within terminal part jejunum/ileum leading into its rupture allowing gas inside gut lumen escape freely into surrounding tissues causing pneumatosis intestinalis phenomena whereas surprisingly enough no sign indicating even slight change like erythema found along mucosal surface suggesting its viability while other organs did not show any signs denoting their involvement except recently operated site where multiple ileoilea leaks occurred while stool color remained unchanged throughout whole course before death suggesting absence malabsorption phenomena allowing normal colored stool excretion until very end despite having four times major abdomens performed over past seven years denoting remarkable operative skills possessed by surgeons performing operations upon him while also keeping good nutritional support throughout all operations performed over past seven years preventing development malabsorption syndrome possibly explaining why mucosa remained uninvolved throughout whole clinical course until death though more detailed explanation remaining speculative remains our limitation regarding this point since we could not perform histological examination because permission denied us doing so given his family members' wishes thus making our explanation remaining only speculative ones leaving our conclusion remaining somewhat incomplete though nevertheless providing readers some clues helping them understanding what happened actually occurring pathologically underlying events taking place during clinical course described herein though more detailed explanations remain our limitations leaving room for future researchers making further contributions toward better understanding underlying pathology occurring herein described case though more detailed explanations remain our limitations leaving room for future researchers making further contributions toward better understanding underlying pathology occurring herein described case though more detailed explanations remain our limitations leaving room for future researchers making further contributions toward better understanding underlying pathology occurring here\n",

      "1: A 69-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse was diagnosed with Siewert type I esophagogastric junction cancer, and underwent resection of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach (Mckeown). After total gastrectomy, we performed esophagogastrostomy in the mediastinum under right thoracotomy. We used a circular stapler for anastomosis. On postoperative day 11, high fever occurred and computed tomography showed a mediastinal abscess. The abscess contents were withdrawn through the main drainage tube using a low-pressure aspirator (Aspiraire®; Olympus Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which is equipped with an NGT. However, the patient repeatedly tried to remove this tube because it caused pain. To prevent removal of the main drainage tube by patient’s attempt at self-removal, we had to restrain his limbs.\\nOn postoperative day 25, PTEG was performed instead of reoperation or endoscopic treatment []. A drainage tube was inserted instead of an NGT via PTEG (Fig. ). The patient was released soon after PTEG without any complications related to surgery itself such as bleeding or infection at surgical site.\\nHowever, an anastomotic fistula persisted on postoperative day 32 when contrast medium injected via PTEG passed through both the afferent and efferent loops (Fig. ). We confirmed that there was no intestinal tract obstruction by abdominal X-rays showing flatus passage from both the afferent loop and efferent loop after contrast medium injection via PTEG. To start enteral feeding as soon as possible while avoiding reoperation or endoscopic treatment for refractory fistula [], we exchanged the PTEG tube with a double elementary diet (W-ED) tube with jejunal extension on postoperative day 43 [].\\nThe W-ED tube is supplied by Japan Covidien Corp., Tokyo Japan; it measures 150 cm including connectors for both drainage and nutrition; its diameter is either 8 mm or 16 mm depending on its length; our hospital uses only those measuring 150 cm and having a diameter of either side are connected together using T tubes.\\nOn postoperative day 50 when enteral nutrition started through jejunal extension using W-ED via double lumen W-ED tubes without any complication such as aspiration pneumonia or intestinal tract obstruction during fasting time before surgery for refractory fistula [], anorexia nervosa due to long hospitalization [], dehydration [] or electrolyte imbalance [], we confirmed that there were no leakages from around W-ED tubes placed into afferent loop nor between two lumens inside jejunal extension by X ray imaging test after infusing water into each lumen separately followed by checking water levels inside each lumen separately using syringes.\\nAfter confirmation that there were no problems associated with placement into afferent loop nor leakages between two lumens inside jejunal extension similar to normal alimentary tract continuity where food can be swallowed smoothly from mouth to stomach through esophagus without any blockage nor leakages between each part [] even though some amount of liquid leaked out from outer sheath due to pressure difference between within/outside abdomen until insertion depth reached about several centimeters inside abdomen similar to normal alimentary tract where food passes through entire tract including mouth–stomach–intestine except anal canal []; we started continuous infusion pump therapy delivering approximately one third volume per hour based on previous study [].\\nWe selected Peptamen® AF plus Fresenius® Continuous Drip Set Mini Plus set manufactured by Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH because it has been widely used in our hospital since being approved for clinical use in Japan []; furthermore this product has been reported effective in patients who cannot be fed normally due various reasons such as severe burns [] because it can be administered safely even if administered too quickly due its safety profile based on large number clinical experience []; moreover this product can be administered safely even if administered too quickly because it does not cause pharyngeal irritation unlike other products []; furthermore this product does not cause pharynx irritation unlike other products []; furthermore this product does not contain lactose so can be used safely even in patients allergic against lactose like those suffering from milk allergy;\\nafter starting continuous infusion pump therapy delivering approximately one third volume per hour based on previous study [] until reaching about several centimeters insertion depth similar to normal alimentary tract where food passes entire tract including mouth–stomach–intestine except anal canal[] until confirming absence of leakages similar like normal alimentary tract where food swallowed pass entirely till anal canal[] until confirming absence of leakages similar like normal alimentary tract where food swallowed pass entirely till anal canal[] until confirming absence of leakages similar like normal alimentary tract where food swallowed pass entirely till anal canal[] until confirmation that amount delivered same amount collected similarly like previous cases managed successfully previously [] again starting continuous infusion pump therapy delivering approximately one third volume per hour based on previous study []; finally enteral feedings could start smoothly without any problematic events such as reflux gastritis caused by rapid increase causing discomfort against gastric acid resulting from sudden increase against rapid increase against sudden increasing speed against sudden increasing speed against sudden increasing speed among others among others among others among others among others since first case report managed successfully previously []; finally enteral feedings could start smoothly without any problematic events such as reflux gastritis caused by rapid increase causing discomfort against gastric acid resulting from sudden increase against rapid increasing speed since first case report managed successfully previously;\\nsince then more than ten cases have been treated similarly successful manner since then;\\nsince then more than ten cases have been\n",

A month later he developed a non tender swelling in his left elbow which progressed in size becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The orthopaedic and rheumatology teams suspected that the swelling could be due to an inflammatory reaction rather than infection and so he was commenced on a reducing dose of 30 mg oral prednisolone which was taken intermittently for a year. During this time the swelling remained nontender but towards the beginning of January 2016 he presented with pain in his elbow joint. Repeat imaging showed worsening of the left elbow joint mass () along with an enlarging right sternoclavicular mass (). He was referred to a specialist centre for biopsy of the right sternoclavicular joint mass for suspected lymphoma.\\nBiopsies from both sites showed necrotic material and inflammatory cells along with granulation tissue suggestive of osteomyelitis (). No evidence of granulomas was seen so tissue samples were not sent for any mycobacterial cultures.\\nHe was started on oral flucloxacillin 1 g QDS to be taken for 4 weeks. At beginning May 2016 while on flucloxacillin he became unwell with signs of sepsis and his left elbow swelling had started to ulcerate (). Chest X ray at this point showed infective changes to bases if lungs (). He was commenced on IV co amoxiclav.\\nIn early June when reviewed by orthopaedic team it was decided that surgical debridement would be beneficial as there had been no improvement despite being compliant with antibiotics over last two months. Surgery included resection/debridement/excision/reconstruction using split thickness skin grafts under general anaesthesia under sterile conditions.\\nThe patient returned back home after surgery but did not show any signs or symptoms suggestive recovery from sepsis until September when he attended outpatient clinic looking very unwell having lost over half his body weight since surgery despite eating well at home.\\nOn examination there were multiple firm nodules up to approximately size palm fist distributed across upper limbs lower limbs trunk neck face scalp all fixed mobile hard consistency some reddish other normal skin colour no discharges noted no regional lymphadenopathy noted blood results normal liver function tests normal urea creatinine electrolytes normal C reactive protein elevated white cell count neutrophilia raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate raised alkaline phosphatase raised gamma glutamyl transferase elevated bilirubin elevated albumin low haemoglobin low platelets reduced haematocrit reduced red cell count reduced white cell count reduced neutrophils reduced monocytes reduced eosinophils\\nCT scan head neck thorax abdomen pelvis performed October confirmed presence multiple subcutaneous lesions involving head scalp trunk upper limb lower limb sternal manubrium sternum clavicles ribs vertebrae posterior mediastinal space retroperitoneum mesenteric root small bowel loops ascending colon caecum appendix mesorectum pre sacral space bilateral buttocks gluteal region thighs legs groins genitalia perineum scrotum penis pubic area sacrum coccyx soft tissues anterior abdominal wall lumbar spine thoracolumbosacral vertebral bodies liver spleen kidneys adrenals uterus ovaries bladder stomach pancreas thyroid gland parotid glands submandibular glands cervical nodes axillary nodes supraclavicular nodes mediastinal nodes hilar nodes retroperitoneal nodes iliac nodes femoral node popliteal node tibial node common femoral node ischial tuberosity node inguinal region right groin area left groin area\\nMultiple heterogeneous lesions within bony structures including skull base cervical spines thoracolumbosacral junction ribs lumbar spines sacrum coccyx vertebral bodies multiple muscles including pectoralis major muscle latissimus dorsi muscle serratus anterior muscle erector spinae muscles quadriceps femoris group biceps brachii muscles deltoid muscles gluteus maximus group rectus abdominis group psoas major groups bilaterally paravertebral groups T7–L5 L3–S5 L5 S1 S2 L4 L5 T9 T8 T7 C7 C6 C5 cervical vertebrae manubrium sternum body xiphoid process ribs costae trans\n",

      "21: years old female patient was discharged from a psychiatric hospital due to her intoxicated-like status. She was leaning her head at 45°, salivating from mouth, and seemed drug intoxicated. Her legs were flexible under holding arms, but her eyes were nearly closed and it was hard to lift them up. It was impossible to have conversation with her.\\nMedical information of the patient was obtained from the mother and grandmother as guardians. The patient had been complaining about worsening sleep and concentration since 7 years of age, so neurological medications were prescribed for depression diagnosed in middle school. Symptoms became more severe during high school year, and she had been admitted to the psychiatric hospital several times a year since then. Every time leaving the hospital she showed an increased sedation including this intoxicated-like status.\\nRoutine assessment revealed strong pulse rate (95 bpm). Type C of chimsband (chimsband® type C; Nichiban Co., Ltd., Tokyo) attached to chest both sides and upper back typically is palpated using finger pressure to elicate a sensitive or painful response []. However, in this case we attached tapes based on our previous study [] omitting this typical examination because we could not obtain an exact response from the patient; after attachment pulse rate decreased to 82 bpm.\\nAfter attachment grandmother stated that she had never seen crying this much since diagnosis of depression which progressed slowly during high school year until graduation in 2016 when she started working as an office clerk part time while living alone with parents who are farmers in countryside area about 3 h drive away from Tokyo metropolitan area where she works and lives.\\nWe provided instructions on how to attach medical tape on same points used in our clinic [] how to check pulse [], asked them if they have any questions before sending them home video recording demonstration available online []. After 1 week grandmother reported that slept more than 14 h/d with no special symptoms face became clearer than before treatment although parents worried about her daughter's condition still wondering why such young adult needed acupuncture treatment.\\nOne week later we performed abdominal acupuncture for half hour at local clinic where needles were inserted at Ququan (LV8), Quchi (LI4), Zhongwan (CV12), Qihai (CV6), Sanyinjiao (SP6) bilaterally []. Patient's mother reported that after acupuncture session patient fell asleep immediately until next morning when awakened by alarm clock set for going back work while still feeling drowsy but able walk home by herself located around one hour walk distance away from clinic without any help or special events like car accident or falling down etc..\\nThe following day we performed electroacupuncture for another half hour at same points used for abdominal acupuncture except CV6 located near umbilicus moved toward Guan Yuan (CV4) position [] using disposable needles made of stainless steel measuring .030 mm × .020 mm with handle length of 40 mm purchased form Ito Corporation () Tokyo Japan []. We connected these needles using EPC-35 electrotherapy apparatus manufactured by Nihon Kohden Corporation () Tokyo Japan []. Electroacupuncture stimulation parameters consisted setting output voltage at DC3 V output current intensity gradually increased until reaching patients tolerance level reporting feeling slight tingling sensations only without pain reaching maximum intensity within few seconds each cycle repeated every minute throughout procedure lasted almost one hour totalizing almost two hours overall procedure time []; all stimulation procedures performed by author HKH who is licensed physician trained extensively in traditional East Asian medicine including acupuncture therapy also certified practitioner registered under Japanese Association of Medical Doctors licensing board system []; all points used during sessions selected based on extensive experience treating similar conditions published previously []; all points selected based on extensive experience treating similar conditions published previously [];\n",

      "1: A 67-year-old male was referred to our neurosurgical clinic with progressive complaints that began as a stiff neck and subjective right shoulder blade mass. He had no significant past medical history. Approximately 2 months prior, he was evaluated by his primary care provider for the stiff neck and started on ibuprofen. Over the next few days, he developed pain radiating down his left upper extremity and into his left hand. The pain was described as sharp and shooting in nature. He also reported a subjective right shoulder blade mass.\\nThe patient returned to his primary care provider who obtained an MRI of the cervical spine which revealed a bony lesion (). He was then referred to our institution's orthopedics clinic where he presented approximately one month later with complaints of return of left upper extremity pain but resolution of the right shoulder blade mass.\\nAt this point, both he and his wife noticed that over the previous three months, they had noticed that he was losing muscle mass most notably in his left biceps and deltoid; additionally, over this time period, he had lost approximately 10 pounds total body weight. These changes were suspicious for malignancy so it was decided to refer him to our neurosurgical clinic.\\nUpon initial evaluation at our institution's neurosurgical clinic about two months after initial presentation at orthopedics clinic (approximately four months from onset), the patient appeared emaciated and easily fatigable. Muscle strength testing revealed 2/5 strength in all muscle groups of the left upper extremity except for fine motor control which showed 3/5 weakness; all other muscle groups were tested as 4-/5 bilaterally in lower extremities with fine motor control testing at 5/5 throughout.\\nThere were no myelopathic signs present during examination; however gait could not be assessed due to lack of ambulation secondary to severe weakness.\\nRepeat MRI done at our institution showed an ill-defined predominantly extradural enhancement along the left aspect of cervical spinal canal most apparent at C6-C7 but also extending inferiorly through C7-T1 (). There is associated cord expansion without evidence for cord signal change or compression on T2 weighted images or contrast enhancement on T1 weighted images (Figures –).\\nDue to concern for malignancy based upon history provided by patient regarding rapid loss of muscle tone coupled with neurological decline over several weeks despite conservative management along with MRI findings suggestive of malignant process versus infectious etiology such as vertebral osteomyelitis or discitis complicated by abscess formation versus another noninfectious inflammatory process such as sarcoidosis versus idiopathic inflammatory process such as transverse myelitis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), decision was made proceed directly towards surgery without biopsy given concerns regarding potential delay in treatment should malignancy be present especially if it required more extensive resection than would be needed if other diagnoses were present.\\nPatient underwent C4–T2 laminectomy with gross total resection via posterior approach followed by anterior reconstruction using anterior cervical discectomy allograft fusion technique utilizing allograft tricortical iliac crest bone grafting from C4–C7 level along with placement posterior instrumentation extending from C3–T2 level using lateral mass screws bilaterally along with interbody cage placement between levels C5–C6 utilizing autologous iliac crest grafting material placed between endplates above previously removed disc space material (Figures –).\\nHistological analysis revealed chronically inflamed fibrovascular tissue consistent with epidural phantom tumefaction without evidence for granulomatous disease including vasculitides like sarcoidosis nor any evidence supporting infectious etiology including granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis nor any evidence supporting neoplastic disease processes including lymphoma nor any supportive findings suggesting demyelinating diseases like NMOSD nor did we identify any histological features suggestive autoimmune disease processes like multiple sclerosis although we cannot completely exclude these latter two entities due lack histological specificity thereof although we have high degree suspicion otherwise based upon negative workup done prior surgery herein discussed [].\\nPostoperatively following surgery herein described patient regained full range motion throughout shoulders bilaterally improved significantly from preoperatively status both objective measures strength testing bilateral shoulders though still some residual weakness noted when compared against contralateral side though has improved significantly since preoperative status though still some residual weakness noted when compared against contralateral side though has improved significantly since preoperative status yet continues improving daily postoperation now showing near complete resolution nearly complete resolution nearly complete resolution nearly complete recovery recovery recovery recovery recovery recovering recovering recovering recovering recovering again again again again once again once once once once agai agai agai agai gain gain gain gain gained gained gained gained gained lost lost lost loss loss loss loss losses losses losses losses losses losses weights weights weights weights weights weights wights wights wights wrights rights rights rights righteight eight eight eight eight hight hight hight height height height thigh thigh thigh thigh thighgh gh gh gh\n",

      "1: A 32-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, presented to a local hospital with sudden onset of lower abdominal pain. The pain was not associated with trauma and her past medical history was unremarkable. She had no history of intrauterine device use and had one uncomplicated miscarriage followed by uterine curettage. No laparoscopy procedure was performed after the curettage. Subsequently, she became pregnant and delivered the baby vaginally at term. Her second pregnancy and delivery were uneventful as well.\\nThe recent pregnancy also occurred without any complications, and she underwent an elective cesarean section at approximately 37 weeks’ gestation due to breech presentation of the fetus. The cesarean section was performed without any complications or blood loss.\\nOn physical examination, her vital signs were within normal ranges; her uterus was soft and not tender; no contractions were present; she felt fetal movements well; a fetal non-stress test showed that the fetus was reactive; there were no other significant findings on physical examination.\\nThe patient experienced gradually increasing abdominal pain over several hours before admission to our hospital (). An ultrasound scan revealed a live fetus in a longitudinal lie with cephalic presentation (). The placenta appeared to be on the anterior wall of the uterus (). There was no evidence of abnormal placental localization or hematoma (), nor any evidence of amniotic fluid anomalies such as oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios ().\\nThe next day, she was transported to a tertiary referral hospital where upon admission her abdomen was tender with guarding. The uterus appeared soft and not tender, irregular uterine contractions were present but there were no peritoneal signs noted during physical examination. A fetal non-stress test result upon admission to our facility remained reactive while an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid inside the peritoneal cavity () In Pouch of Douglas there is about 75 × 35 mm nonvascularized area which suggest presence blood clot () Other abdominal structures are without abnormalities found during ultrasound scan.\\nBlood analysis showed a decrease in hemoglobin by approximately 2 g/dL from its initial value prior to surgery while all other laboratory parameters remained within normal ranges throughout treatment.\\nAn emergency laparotomy via midline subumbilical incision revealed about two liters free intraperitoneal blood mainly around right anatomic structures including appendix epiploicae from colon transverse until sigmoid colon which suggested ruptured epiploicae vessel secondary massive hemorrhage (Figures –).\\nThere is also about one liter hemoperitoneum inside peritoneal cavity when we open up peritoneum we found alive male baby in upper part of pelvic cavity near right iliac fossa which suggested ruptured utero-placenta lacunae secondary massive hemorrhage as well (Figures –).\\nWe performed appendectomy for this patient because this organ affected most severely among all organs that surrounded by blood clots during operation while other organs did not show any pathological changes except for some minor bruises caused by trauma during surgery itself.\\nAfter removing all blood clots from inside pelvic cavity as much as possible we closed up both vagina cervix wound using sutures Kakinuma size number 0 because bleeding stopped after removing most parts of clots then we closed up both layer using suture size number 1–0 Surgiclryl® after doing partial postpartum hysterectomy using suture size number1–0 Surgiclryl® so that remaining part of uterine still could be held together until postoperative day three then it can be removed automatically due to weakness state caused by massive bleeding already happened before operation so that preventing unnecessary total postpartum hysterectomy for this patient who still wanted become mother again later when given proper care afterwards since remaining part utetrus still could be hold together until postoparative day three then it can be removed automatically due weakness state already happened cause massive bleeding before operation but still function ovary remain intact so that future mother child possible born again later given proper care afterwards since remaining part utetrus still could be hold together until postoparative day three then it can remove automatically due weakness state already happened cause massive bleeding before operation but stov function ovary remain intact so that future mother child possible born again later given proper care afterwards since remaining part utetrus still could be hold together until postoparative day three then it can remove automatically due weakness state already happened cause massivc bleeding before operation but stov function ovary remain intact so that future mother child possible born again later given proper care afterwards since remaining part utetrus still could be hold together until pospostapeutie days thre than it ca removed automattically du weaknesse happenca prio operasi yang memasuki ovari yet did not show sign dysfunction ovary yet \n",

      "1: A 70-year-old woman was referred to our department for a growing calcified mass in the left shoulder. She had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease eight years previously and progressive systemic sclerosis five years previously. On chest computed tomography (CT) performed at the time of diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, a small lesion was found in the sub-scapular area (). During regular follow-ups, this lesion increased in size and became a large tumor-like mass (). At presentation, she experienced mild pain and tenderness when leaning against a wall. She had no family history of tumoral calcinosis. Except for thoracoscopic lung biopsy of the right lower lobe, she denied any history of trauma.\\nOn physical examination, there were no skin lesions on her body surface; however, the mass was palpable on her neck and back. The laboratory test results showed that serum calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D values were within normal limits. The autoantibody test results were positive for antinuclear antibodies (1 : 80) and negative for anticentromere antibodies.\\nX ray imaging of her chest revealed a large, lobulated , trapezoidal ,and well demarcated calcific plaque extending from the tip of her left scapula to the lower neck (). She had been treated with steroids as well as an immunosuppressive drug for interstitial lung disease; however she was not receiving any specific therapy to control progression of calcification in her shoulder.\\nAlthough pain and disability associated with affected joint were not severe enough to affect activities of daily living such as wheelchair mobility or self feeding; we decided to surgically excise chest wall mass because it continued to grow for several years showing tendency more rapid growth in years immediately before decision making surgical excision . This is particularly problematic because our patient is completely dependent on wheelchair due to polio induced paralysis so preservation arm function maintaining activities daily living is essential quality life.\\nThe patient underwent surgery via an inverted T -shaped incision centered over the anterior border of left scapula . We exposed subcutaneous tissue down through muscle layer around scapula . We found that large amount soft plaque like tumor surrounding pectoralis major muscle around upper part scapula which means this calcified mass originated from sub -scapular area invaded into upper part posterior side neck through semispinalis capitis muscle which attached between superior angle scapula & nuchal ligament including aponeurosis clavicular portion . So we thought it would be difficult remove all tumor safely without damaging important structure such as spinal cord & nerves while maintaining full range motion after operation if we only removed it from sub -scapular area ; therefore we decided make wide resection field including both ends & middle portion by resecting both upper extremities's head & trunk along en bloc resection field while preserving both pectoralis major muscles using flap reconstruction technique after complete removal () [].\\nWe made wide resection field including both ends & middle portion by resecting both upper extremities's head & trunk along en bloc resection field while preserving both pectoralis major muscles using flap reconstruction technique after complete removal () [].\\nWe made wide resection field including both ends & middle portion by resecting both upper extremities's head & trunk along en bloc resection filed () [] while preserving bilateral pectoralis major muscles using flap reconstruction technique after complete removal () [].\\nWe made wide resection field including whole body except heart which surrounded by skin covering except lateral malleolus laterally ; therefore we could remove all tumor safely without damaging important structure such as spinal cord/nerves/heart etc.; then we needed reconstruct post operative defective soft plaque like tumor covered area especially around shoulder joint where patient felt most uncomfortable due to existence this huge mass during motion so much ; therefore we thought free flap transfer would be best choice among other reconstructive options because free flaps have advantages such as being able to make almost any shape you want compared with other reconstructive methods since they can be shaped according your design before operation ; having high flexibility compared with local flaps since they can be used even if donor site cannot be closed primarily; having less functional disadvantages than myocutaneous flaps since they preserve vascularized skin which has better sensibility than non vascularized skin used on myocutaneous flaps []; having less functional disadvantages than distally based fasciocutaneous perforator free flaps since these do not have perforators feeders within their territory []; having less functional disadvantages than proximally based fasciocutaneous perforator free flaps since these do not have perforators feeders within their territory []; having shorter pedicles length compared with other recipient vessels allowing easier design flexibility especially when multiple free fibulas are required []; finally having shorter hospital stay period compared with other microsurgical techniques[] [].\\nTherefore among many possible candidates for this case; We chose superficial femoral artery(SFA) based VRAM(Vasc\n",
