In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.\nOn the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax.

{"idx":80176,"data":"A 49-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall. The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.\nIn the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins","conversation":"\nDoctor: Good morning, Mr. [Patient's Name]. I'm Dr. [Doctor's Name].

And what happened after that?\nPatient: A week later, I had similar pain in my left groin and couldn't bear weight on either lower limb. I've been bedridden since then.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you had any other symptoms besides the inability to walk?\nPatient: No, just the pain in my groins and the inability to walk.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and our clinical findings, it seems that you have a coxa vara deformity of your bilateral hips with a possibility of a bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the femur neck.\nDoctor: There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance or altered pigmentation, or precocious puberty.\nDoctor: Our imaging showed that you have suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur.\nDoctor: The imaging of the other bones showed evidence of the fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of your left tibia.\nDoctor: The magnetic resonance scanning of your bilateral hip region showed features consistent with fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur shaft along with a sub-capital fracture of the femur neck, without evidence of avascular necrosis of the femur head.\nDoctor: All of your blood and serum biochemical tests, such as your hemoglobin, total and differential white cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels, and all of your hormonal studies were within normal limits.\nDoctor: Based on all of these findings, we have decided to do both correction of the deformity to realign the head, neck, and shaft, and to achieve valgus at the neck-shaft region and a horizontal configuration neck fracture, increasing the chances of union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur, in one stage, each side at a time.\nDoctor: On the right side, we first did an oblique osteotomy from just distal to the greater trochanter.\nDoctor: This procedure will help to correct your deformity and realign your bones to allow you to walk again.\nDoctor: You will need to come back for follow-up appointments so that we can monitor your progress and make sure that everything is healing properly.\nDoctor: Is there anything you would like to ask or discuss before we proceed with the next step?\nPatient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. I'll see you at your next appointment.

He has been concerned with having a cancer that would give him only few days to live. At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.\nThe patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named.
