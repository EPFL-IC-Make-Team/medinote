The patient was in good state and very active. There was not any health problem in the past except a thoracic trauma at work one year ago. In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.\nOn the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax. After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 \u00d7 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it. The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers. On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm (). The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes and no other lesion was seen in adjacent organs. The conclusion of the radiologist was that probably this was the case of a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs and a biopsy of the tumor was recommended.\nBecause there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology it was decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall. So, through a small posterior thoracotomy at 7th intercostal space were sampled five nodular lesions from the right lung and a sample from the tumor.

{"data":"A 49-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall. The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.\nIn the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins","conversation":"\nDoctor: Good morning, Mr. [Patient's Name]. I'm Dr. [Doctor's Name].

Examination showed decreased air entry on the left side and a subsequent chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest and a further ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney. A computed tomography (CT) of her thorax was performed, which confirmed left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis; she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.\nThe procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position. A 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port. The examination confirmed the CT findings (\n). The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect which then revealed a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerota's fascia (\n).\nThe kidney was then reduced into the abdominal cavity retroperitoneally by pushing it down through the diaphragmatic defect (\n). A primary repair using interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension (\n).

At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.\nThe patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again.

So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient.

{"data":"A 64-year-old Caucasian man from Austria was referred to the urological department because of episodes of intermittent gross hematuria. The patient had a colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before. After radiotherapy ureteric strictures developed on both sides and ureteric stents were placed. At the time of admission the urine specimen showed few white and red blood cells and the urine culture was sterile. During the change of the ureteric stents a retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy were performed, showing a mild gross hematuria coming out of the right ureteric orifice but no further pathological findings. After the stent change, first the hematuria cleared but one day later again an episode of gross hematuria with blood clots in the bladder occurred. A transurethral catheter was placed and a multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed. CT detected no source of bleeding. The gross hematuria cleared again and an ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides were performed with special emphasis on the right ureter. Once again nothing suspicious could be found. Thereafter gross hematuria appeared again with massive hemorrhage and an arteriography was performed (). But once again no underlying reason for the bleeding could be found. Two days later a gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage occurred. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion of 6 U. Therefore, the indication for nephrectomy of the suspicious right side was set and performed. During the operation the ureteric stent was removed and at the end of the operation the hematuria stopped. When the patient left the operation room again a massive hemorrhage was identified within the bladder catheter. Again an arteriography was performed. Finally, the region of the fistula was identified at the distal common iliac artery and a stent graft was deployed across the fistula (). A postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula (). After adequate blood transfusion and fluid replacement the patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery. Twelve months later the patient is still well and the stent graft remains patent.

After the stent change, did the hematuria clear up? \nPatient: At first, yes, but then one day later there was another episode of gross hematuria with blood clots in the bladder. \nDoctor: I see. And a transurethral catheter was placed, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And a multiphase CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, but no source of bleeding was detected. \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: And an ureteroscopy was performed on both ureteric sides with special emphasis on the right ureter, but nothing suspicious was found. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And then there was another episode of gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And an arteriography was performed, but once again no underlying reason for the bleeding was found. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And two days later, there was another episode of gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage and the patient became hemodynamically unstable, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And the patient needed a blood transfusion of 6 units, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And the indication for nephrectomy of the suspicious right side was set and performed, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And during the operation, the ureteric stent was removed and the hematuria stopped, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And after the operation, there was a massive hemorrhage within the bladder catheter, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And an arteriography was performed and the region of the fistula was identified at the distal common iliac artery and a stent graft was deployed across the fistula, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And a postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And after adequate blood transfusion and fluid replacement, the patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: And twelve months later, the patient is still well and the stent graft remains patent, but the patient lost the right kidney, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's correct. \nDoctor: Thank you for your cooperation. I will go over your medical history and test results and get back to you with a plan of action. \nPatient: Thank you, doctor. \n","idx":92167,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Episodes of intermittent gross hematuria\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Intermittent gross hematuria and subsequent complications\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": \"Urological department\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"64\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": \"Caucasian\",\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"Colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before; post-radiotherapy ureteric strictures developed on both sides with ureteric stents placed\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Massive hemorrhage and unstable hemodynamics due to gross hematuria\",\n            \"Type\": \"Nephrectomy of the right side\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": \"Hematuria stopped, but later massive hemorrhage occurred\",\n            \"details\": \"Ureteric stent was removed during the operation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Massive hemorrhage identified within the bladder catheter post-nephrectomy\",\n            \"Type\": \"Deployment of a stent graft across the fistula at the distal common iliac artery\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": \"Complete closure of the fistula\",\n            \"details\": \"Postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Intermittent gross hematuria\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": \"Gross\",\n            \"location\": \"Bladder\/Ureter\",\n            \"time\": \"Intermittent\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Cleared after stent change but recurred with blood clots in the bladder\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Urine specimen analysis\",\n            \"result\": \"Few white and red blood cells, sterile urine culture\",\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy\",\n            \"result\": \"Mild gross hematuria coming out of the right ureteric orifice, no further pathological findings\",\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis\",\n            \"result\": \"No source of bleeding detected\",\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides\",\n            \"result\": \"Nothing suspicious found\",\n            \"details\": \"Special emphasis on the right ureter\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Arteriography\",\n            \"result\": \"No underlying reason for the bleeding found on first arteriography; region of the fistula identified at the distal common iliac artery on subsequent arteriography\",\n            \"details\": \"Stent graft deployed across the fistula\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [],\n    \"treatments\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Blood transfusion\",\n            \"related condition\": \"Hemodynamic instability due to massive hemorrhage\",\n            \"dosage\": \"6 units\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"To stabilize hemodynamics\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": \"Rapid and unremarkable recovery\",\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"discharge\": {\n        \"reason\": \"Rapid and unremarkable recovery after treatment\",\n        \"referral\": None,\n        \"follow up\": None,\n        \"discharge summary\": \"Patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery, lost his right kidney, and twelve months later is still well with the stent graft remaining patent.\"\n    }\n}"}
{"data":"The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU\/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition []. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A [], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination ().

{"data":"A 47 year old gentleman presented to his general practitioner with acute onset lower back pain. The pain had commenced during coitus and radiated down the right leg. The initial diagnosis was of acute disc prolapse and he was referred for an urgent neurosurgical opinion. The neurosurgeon concurred that the pain may well have been of neurological origin and arranged an MRI scan. This was reported as showing no evidence of spinal cord pathology. The patient was reassured with the results of the MRI findings and was advised the pain was probably musculoskeletal in origin and should settle. Over the subsequent 6 weeks, the pain persisted and indeed increased in severity. The patient noted claudication-type pain in his right leg after approximately 100 metres. As the pain had not resolved after 6 weeks he revisited his general practitioner. During the subsequent examination the pulses in his right leg were noted to be absent and he was referred for an urgent vascular surgical opinion.\nThe patient was seen the following day in the vascular clinic where a history of severe acute claudication-type pain was noted in the right leg. There was a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which he took relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease. On clinical examination the heart rate was 68 beats per minute regular. The blood pressure in the right arm 130\/70 mmHg was lower than that of the left arm 160\/80. Cardiac examination was normal. There was no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the limbs revealed that the right lower limb pulses were all absent whilst those of the left leg were present and of good volume. An urgent abdominal ultrasound scan was arranged which demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta and a subsequent CT scan (Figures , , ) confirmed that the dissection was a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap was identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Good morning doctor, I have been experiencing severe lower back pain for the past few weeks.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? When did it start?\nPatient: It started during coitus and it radiates down my right leg.\nDoctor: Hmm, I understand. Did you see a doctor before coming here?\nPatient: Yes, I was referred to a neurosurgeon for an urgent opinion. They thought it might be a disc prolapse.\nDoctor: I see. And did you have an MRI scan?\nPatient: Yes, I did. The results showed no evidence of spinal cord pathology.\nDoctor: That's good news. The findings probably indicate that the pain is musculoskeletal in origin and should settle on its own.\nPatient: But the pain has increased in severity and I have claudication-type pain in my right leg after walking about 100 meters.\nDoctor: I see. And has the pain resolved after 6 weeks?\nPatient: No, it has not. That's why I came back to see my general practitioner.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. Can I perform a physical examination on you now?\nPatient: Yes, of course.\nDoctor: (performing the examination) There's a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which you take relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your heart rate is 68 beats per minute and it's regular. The blood pressure in your right arm is 130\/70 mmHg, which is lower than that of the left arm 160\/80. Cardiac examination is normal. There's no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. (Examining the limbs) The right lower limb pulses are all absent whilst those of the left leg are present and of good volume.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: I think we need to do an abdominal ultrasound scan to check what's causing the pain.\nPatient: Okay, sounds good.\nDoctor: (after the scan) The scan has demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta. I would like to arrange a CT scan to confirm the findings.\nPatient: Sure, I understand.\nDoctor: (after the CT scan) The CT scan has confirmed that the dissection is a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap has been identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: It means that there's a tear in the wall of your aorta, which is the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. This is a serious condition and requires immediate attention.\nPatient: What should I do now?\nDoctor: You need to be admitted to the hospital as soon as possible for further treatment.

{"data":"An 82-year-old female with 60 kg body weight and 156 cm height who was otherwise healthy underwent a right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis under epidural anesthesia at a hospital nearby. The insertion of the epidural catheter and operation were finished without any problems and the removal of the epidural catheter was attempted as usual two days after the operation. The epidural catheter broke during its removal. The physician felt resistance when he tried to pull out the catheter and then the catheter was broken 13 cm from the tip. X-rays and a computed tomography scan were subsequently taken (). Although the catheter fragment retaining within the patient was long, a wait-and-see approach was initially employed because there was no neurological deficit. The effusion from the drain hole stopped two days later. No neurological deficit or fever developed after the first evaluation of the images. However, the migration of the catheter was found by imaging studies four weeks after the occurrence of the catheter breakage (). After detailed discussions with the patient and her family it was decided that a surgical removal of the retained catheter should be performed. Then, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThere was no neurological deficit at the time of admission. A laminectomy was performed at L2-3 seven weeks after the catheter had broken. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia and then the spinal level that needed to be treated and the retained catheter were identified by using an image intensifier. We exposed the spinal process at L2-3 and the L2 spinal process was split by an air drill. The catheter was confirmed to be present between the L2 and L3 spinous processes and the edge of the catheter was found to be broken (). The catheter went entered the epidural space through the flavum.\nAfter removal of the bilateral flavum in an usual manner the catheter was found to be coiled up at the surface of the dura mater and was covered by a thin reactive film (). The catheter was heading to the nerve root","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I am feeling okay, doctor.\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

{"data":"A 78 year old Caucasian male presented to our casualty 6 weeks following admission elsewhere with a history of swelling of the right leg and a pulmonary embolus. He had undergone VQ scanning with a proven diagnosis of pulmonary embolus and was therefore anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin.\nOn admission he had swelling of the right knee and lower thigh with loss of sensation on the dorsolateral aspect of the right foot. Clinical examination revealed a large mass in the right popliteal fossa. The initial diagnosis was that of deep venous thrombosis and imaging was undertaken and the patient referred for a vascular opinion.\nOn vascular review, the patient had a pulsatile mass comparable with a popliteal artery aneurysm of 12 cms diameter on the right and 6 cms on the left. His foot was warm and well perfused and his INR was 2.6. He underwent a duplex scan of the lower limb arteries which revealed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta of 3.4 cms in diameter. A further CT arteriogram (fig , ) confirmed that in fact the swelling on the right side was indeed a pseudo aneurysm following rupture with peripheral calcification.\nThe dilemma was therefore a patient with an established pulmonary embolus and a friable clot in the iliac veins, anticoagulation and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Due to lack of expertise we elected to continue with full anticoagulation rather than place an inferior vena caval filter. Operative exploration was performed through a medial approach under full anticoagulation and the right popliteal artery was found to contain a large volume of blood pointing laterally. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded. Duplex examination of the upper and lower limb veins revealed that the veins were of small diameter therefore revascularization of the leg was established by an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft. Due to continuous oozing, the aneurysm sac was packed and the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Six weeks later he underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm.","conversation":"\nDoctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Not too good, doctor.

{"data":"On the 24th April 2006 a 9 month old girl was brought to the Emergency Department of a hospital which routinely refers patients to us. She had sustained a dog bite to her face 30 minutes previously. She was seen by the emergency physicians and was found to have received multiple lacerations to her face over the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek and over her left body of her mandible. She was fully examined and found to have no wounds elsewhere however due to the circumstances of patient and parental distress, intra-oral examination was not possible. The initial work up did not include radiographic investigations as it was felt by the emergency physicians that only a soft tissue injury was sustained. On the advice of the on-call maxillofacial team she had her facial wounds cleaned with aqueous iodine solution and she was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol.

What brings you here today?\n\nPatient: Hi, I'm here because of a dog bite I received on my face.\n\nDoctor: Oh, I see. Can you tell me more about the dog bite? When did it happen?\n\nPatient: It happened 30 minutes ago. I received multiple lacerations on my face, including my right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek, and over my left body of my mandible.\n\nDoctor: I see. And have you been examined by the emergency physicians yet?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have. They found no wounds elsewhere, but due to my and my parents' distress, an intra-oral examination was not possible.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And did they perform a radiographic investigation?\n\nPatient: No, they didn't. They thought that I only sustained a soft tissue injury.\n\nDoctor: I see. Did they give you any advice on how to treat the wounds?\n\nPatient: Yes, they did. They cleaned my facial wounds with aqueous iodine solution and started me on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And did you have an examination by an ophthalmologist?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did. They found no ocular injury.\n\nDoctor: Okay.

Patient also had metastasis to tail of the pancreas and tip of spleen 6 years ago which was followed by total resection of pancreas and spleen. Patient was followed up for RCC and was last seen 2 years ago when his PET\/CT showed slightly increased hypermetabolic area in the biceps femoris muscle which was interpreted as a muscle injury secondary to the rarity of the metastasis to the skeletal muscle from RCC. Patient during the current follow up visit developed a large mass in the posterior side of the thigh which was present for more than a year. As per patient, the mass initially was diagnosed as a blood clot on venous doppler, for which he was treated by his primary care physician with warfarin for more than 6 months. However, the mass progressively increased in size. Patient did not mention of any other constitutional symptoms. On physical examination, a painless, tense mass along the length of biceps femoris muscle measuring more than 25 cm was found in the posterior aspect of the left thigh. The mass was hypervascular and numerous varicosities of different sizes were noticeable on the surface. Patient was imaged using FDG-PET\/CT which showed hypermetabolic activity with an uptake value of 3.8 to 4.1 in biceps femoris muscle with multiple serpiginous vessels throughout the tumor, in accordance with a large cavernous hemangioma or an angiosarcoma.

{"data":"Our patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female with medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago with lumpectomy of the left breast and axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to her postoperatively, and Anastrozole was prescribed to her for 5 years. She underwent regular annual follow-up for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease. Seven years after the initial treatment for breast cancer, abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter as well as a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas (, left). Tumor markers AFP, CA 15\u20133, CA 19\u20139, and CEA were all within normal limits and the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region. Moreover, biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.\nSubsequently the patient went through oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered to be resectable, although controversy arose whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies were proposed as minimal invasive methods of diagnosis. The patient rejected both of them due to the risk for possible complications and cancer spillage and decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. After accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, we performed hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII and rapid biopsy was taken which showed primary HCC. Moreover, after entering the lesser sac, a second rapid biopsy was taken from the lesion at the pancreatic tail which showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy (). We decided to perform resection of hepatic segments VI and VII since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound also confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins.

{"data":"A 74 year-old Caucasian woman with complete heart block had dual chamber pacemaker implanted in 1990. Her initial system included a Medtronic 4504 passive fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4004 passive fixation ventricular lead. She subsequently underwent replacement of her pulse generator in 1998 and insertion of a new Medtronic 5568 active fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4068 ventricular leads in August 2003 due to lead failure. She underwent a subsequent generator change in June 2011. The original atrial and ventricular leads were abandoned when the new leads were added in 2003. All procedures had been undertaken at a referring institution and she had not had any prior open-heart surgical procedures. The patient presented at her home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket in February 2014. Blood cultures did not grow any bacterial or fungal organisms. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed to assess for vegetations on the leads. No vegetations were identified, but there was suspicion that one her atrial lead was extravascular. She underwent chest computerized tomographic imaging and this study revealed that one of her right atrial lead tips was approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space (Figure ). The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone based on a diagnosis of suspected pacemaker pocket infection. She underwent pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, but extraction was not undertaken due to the increased risks involved with the lead being extra-vascular. No organism was identified from samples of fluid cultured during that initial debridement procedure. Despite that debridement procedure and prolonged antibiotics there was clinical recurrence of the infection and the patient was subsequently transferred to our center for complex lead extraction.\nTo minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade given the chronic right atrial lead perforation, a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken.

{"data":"We report the case of a 59-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both of which were being treated by his primary physician. The patient suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013 owing to a fall and underwent surgery. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the time were focused on the lumbar spine, so other organs were barely included in the image range and no contrast medium was used. However, when carefully observed retrospectively, the CT scan showed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection of the abdominal aorta (). However, there was no mention of localized aortic dissection, because the dissection was fairly localized and did not show any abnormal findings, such as aneurysm formation. In addition, the adventitia causing the aortic dissection was also calcified. The findings suggested a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.\nIn March 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. He had no abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication. On physical examination, palpation of the abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and the patient subsequently consulted his family doctor. After abdominal ultrasound examination, the patient's doctor diagnosed him with an AAA. He subsequently referred the patient to another hospital for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA. After the enhanced CT scan, the patient was referred to our hospital, where we determined that urgent treatment was necessary owing to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.\nAlthough he did not have any findings suggestive of an infectious disease such as fever or pain, we first considered the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm because it was an irregular aneurysm.

An oral examination","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm okay, doctor.\nDoctor: I'd like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Can you tell me about your previous medical conditions?\nPatient: Yes, I have hypertension and dyslipidemia. Both of them were treated by my primary doctor.\nDoctor: I see. And have you ever suffered from any injuries or surgeries?\nPatient: Yes, I had a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013 because of a fall. I underwent surgery.\nDoctor: Okay. Did you have any CT scans at that time?\nPatient: Yes, I did.\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about the CT scans?\nPatient: The CT scans were focused on my lumbar spine, so other organs were barely included in the image range and no contrast medium was used.\nDoctor: I see. But when the CT scans were observed retrospectively, did they show anything unusual?\nPatient: Yes, they showed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of my abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection of my abdominal aorta.\nDoctor: Okay. Did the CT scans show any abnormal findings, such as an aneurysm formation?\nPatient: No, there was no mention of any abnormal findings.\nDoctor: I see. And was the adventitia causing the aortic dissection calcified?\nPatient: Yes, it was.\nDoctor: So, the findings suggest a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Can you tell me what happened in March 2020?\nPatient: I was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. I had no abdominal pain.\nDoctor: I see. And what did the doctor diagnose you with?\nPatient: I was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication.\nDoctor: Okay. And did you have any physical examination after that?\nPatient: Yes, I did.\nDoctor: Can you tell me what happened during the physical examination?\nPatient: Palpation of my abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and I subsequently consulted my family doctor.\nDoctor: I see. And after the abdominal ultrasound examination, what did your doctor diagnose you with?\nPatient: My doctor diagnosed me with an AAA.\nDoctor: Okay.

{"data":"Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor.

At the left side, spectral data for the ECA () and the particular branching which demonstrates that the vessel is ECA indeed were present, whereas there was no Doppler signal and gray-scale findings for the ICA (). Because the left CCA was hypoplastic and there were no findings of atherosclerotic plaques in other arterial segments; it was thought that the left ICA might not be suffering an occlusion at all, but instead it might well be agenetic.

CT images revealed a normally appearing right carotid canal but no clear image of the left one (). Then, the previous angiographic images of the patient were reevaluated, and it was then recognized that the left ECA and its branches were well visible, while the left ICA and its branches did not show any filling with contrast ().

He was otherwise well, though was currently unable to perform any activities that involved prolonged weight bearing and found it increasingly difficult to continue his occupation within allied health care.\nThe patient noted an initial diagnosis of OCD at age 13. This was appropriately treated conservatively with a period of reduced load and protected weight bearing. He was later able to return to sport - which included Australian Rules football.\nDue to recurrence of pain he underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14. Arthroscopic probing of the OCD lesion indicated that it was stable and conservative management and further unloading was pursued. The patient failed conservative management and 1 year later underwent a repeat arthroscopy at which time an unstable 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm lesion involving his medial femoral condyle was removed. It was felt that as the fragment had little subchondral bone that direct repair was not achievable. A further arthroscopy was performed 8 months later and a chondral biopsy was taken for later autologous chondrocyte transplantation. At the time it was noted that no healing had occurred at the site of the defect.\nTwo months later, the treating surgeon, using a lateral arthrotomy approach, patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI). The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue. One year later, and due to persistent discomfort and swelling of the knee, the patient underwent a further arthroscopy. It was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, yet an inner area of 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm had failed to fill completely.\nAt age 23 and due to troubling discomfort and mechanical features of instability the patient underwent another arthroscopy. Numerous loose bodies within both the medial and lateral compartments were washed out. The area of the past OCD and MACI graft had failed with exposure of underlying subchondral bone and formation of a large subchondral cyst.","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor.

{"data":"Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor.

{"data":"A 56-year-old female was initially admitted to the neurosurgical department because of retroorbital pain and mild visual deterioration in both eyes. The ophthalmologic examination showed a bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in the visual acuity on the right side. A magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) disclosed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the ICA on the right side (). Although there is no randomized evidence showing that the FDs are superior to the conventional treatment options, the FD option was considered for the following reasons: the paraclinoid ICA represents one of the best targets for such devices [], there were no anatomical limitations to a correct deployment, and, by inducing aneurysm shrinkage, it might have been possible to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways []. The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled and then a Pipeline FD was placed in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck (). The FD was well deployed and the landing zone extended from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA (). There was only a mild focal narrowing at the level of the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the bulk of the aneurysms against the clinoid process (). The visual acuity deteriorated acutely on both sides despite corticosteroids. The patient was discharged home after 7 days with double antiplatelet medication (75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day).

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Good morning, I am feeling okay.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me why you were admitted to the hospital?\n\nPatient: I had retroorbital pain and some mild visual deterioration in both eyes.\n\nDoctor: I see. And have you had any ophthalmologic examination?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me what the examination showed?\n\nPatient: The examination showed a bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in the visual acuity on the right side.\n\nDoctor: I understand. And what other tests did you have?\n\nPatient: I had a magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. And what did the tests show?\n\nPatient: The tests showed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the ICA on the right side.\n\nDoctor: I see. So, what was the treatment option that was considered for you?\n\nPatient: The doctor said that there was no randomized evidence showing that the FDs are superior to the conventional treatment options, but the FD option was considered because the paraclinoid ICA represents one of the best targets for such devices, there were no anatomical limitations to a correct deployment, and by inducing aneurysm shrinkage, it might have been possible to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways.\n\nDoctor: I understand. And what was done during the procedure?\n\nPatient: The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled and then a Pipeline FD was placed in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. And what was the result of the placement?\n\nPatient: The FD was well deployed and the landing zone extended from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA. There was only a mild focal narrowing at the level of the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the bulk of the aneurysms against the clinoid process.\n\nDoctor: I understand. And what happened after the procedure?\n\nPatient: The visual acuity deteriorated acutely on both sides despite corticosteroids.\n\nDoctor: I see. And when were you discharged from the hospital?\n\nPatient: I was discharged home after 7 days with double antiplatelet medication.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. And what was the medication?\n\nPatient: I was taking 75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day.\n\nDoctor: I understand. And what happened three months after the procedure?\n\nPatient: I acutely developed a hemiparesis on the left side that lasted 48 hours. Then, I began suffering from transient ischemic attacks.\n\nDoctor: I see.

{"data":"A 63-year-old German man with a long past history of tumours was admitted to hospital. 20 years ago a malignant melanoma had been diagnosed on his right loin and radical excision performed. Due to lymph node metastasis in the left groin the patient had chemotherapy. After some time the patient developed haematuria whereupon renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed in the right kidney and a metastasis of the melanoma was found in the left kidney. Partial nephrectomy on the right and complete nephrectomy on the left were performed. The patient had since been free of tumour recurrence until presentation.\nA recent chest X-ray showed a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung . Two computer tomography examinations of the chest (fig ) were performed but could not conclusively rule out the possibility of metastasis. It was diagnosed initially as an inflammatory process of the lung. When the shadow failed to change with time further investigations were ordered. This was when a tumour in the right atrium was discovered which was neither haemodynamically nor clinically relevant. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest showed a spherical tumour (28 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 20 mm) attached to the wall of the right atrium. The T1 weighted image revealed homogenous signal intensity as well as a loss of signal due to fat tissue. The tumour didn't show any signs of contrast medium uptake so that the diagnosis of a benign lipoma was made preoperatively. Transthoracic echocardiography excluded heart valve dysfunction and confirmed the presence of a mass in the right atrium.\nOn account of the above-mentioned criteria and of the absence of metastasis of the melanoma excision of the lipoma as well as a biopsy of the mass in the right lower lobe was planned.

{"data":"Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor.

{"data":"Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor.

{"data":"A six year-old boy presented with a congenital anomaly of two upper limbs on the right side [Figures \u2013]. Clinical examination revealed that the superior limb was articulating with the shoulder joint, and the inferior limb laterally attached to the chest wall. Both these limbs on the right side were hypoplastic compared to the left upper limb. The superior limb was approximately 7 cm shorter than the opposite limb (normal side), the superior limb being 33 cm in length from the shoulder joint while the inferior limb was 18 cm from the attachment with the chest wall. The skin over the forearm on the superior limb was shiny and atrophic with very little soft tissue mass compared with the inferior limb which was bulkier with normal-appearing skin. The superior limb was articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint. The scapula was small compared to that on the opposite side. The inferior limb was attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space. The superior limb had a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger. There was synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint was stable. All fingers showed symphalyngism; the middle ray including the 3rd metacarpal was absent. The inferior limb had two fingers and a single bone with which it was attached to the chest wall. Clinically, the superior limb presented a picture of an ulnar hypoplastic hand where there was a stable wrist joint and a fused elbow joint. The inferior limb presented like a radial club hand with instability of the wrist joint. All movements were possible at the shoulder joint level but none were possible at the elbow joint and the wrist joint in the superior limb. Hand function was better in the inferior limb.

And how is the upper limb attached to the torso?\n\nPatient: It's articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint.\n\nDoctor: And how is the lower limb attached to the chest wall?\n\nPatient: It's attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what bones are present in the upper limb?\n\nPatient: There's a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger.\n\nDoctor: And what about the joints in the upper limb?\n\nPatient: There's synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint is stable.\n\nDoctor: And what about the lower limb?\n\nPatient: The lower limb has two fingers and a single bone with which it's attached to the chest wall.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what's the stability of the wrist joint in the lower limb?\n\nPatient: It's unstable.\n\nDoctor: And what movements are possible at the elbow joint and wrist joint in the upper limb?\n\nPatient: None.\n\nDoctor: Alright. And what about the hand function in the two limbs?\n\nPatient: The hand flexors are stronger in the lower limb while the extensors are stronger in the upper limb.\n\nDoctor: I see. Alright, based on the examination, it appears that your son has a congenital anomaly in his right arm. We'll need to run some tests to determine the best course of treatment.\n\n[Conversation ends]\n\n\n[Conversation starts with the patient's family]\n\nDoctor: Good morning, how are you today?\n\nFamily member: Hello, we're here to follow up on our son's condition.\n\nDoctor: Of course.

Five months after the completion of the study this participant suffered an inversion right ankle sprain during a rainstorm while leaping into a camping tent filled with children.

A new clinical examination evidenced a spontaneous alveolar bleeding and high mobility of the first and second molars of the fourth mandibular quadrant. The patient denied cervicofacial trauma or pathologies of the coagulation system. Thus, a CT scan of the cervicofacial area was performed to reach a diagnosis. Surprisingly, this test evidenced a large high-flow intraosseous arteriovenous malformation extending from the right mandibular body to the homolateral pterygoid region and the infratemporal fossa (Fig. ). Moreover, a selective arteriography and a MRI of head and neck were also carried out to identify the limits of the malformation and the key vessel (Fig. ). Considering these findings, we contacted with the interventional radiology unit of the Hospital in order to plan a combined approach. However, after a careful analysis we decided to treat the patient only with an endovascular approach. Specifically, a very large drainage vein was identified with the radiological tests. Hence, we hypothesized that the embolization of this vein and the selective embolization of the main arterial vessels might be enough to treat the pathology. Thus, under general anesthesia and femoral approach, the embolization of the main drainage vein and of the most accessible arteries was carried out. The patient was maintained intubated and sedated for 24 hours and he was extubated when the bleeding had completely stopped. He was discharged from the hospital 7 days after the procedure. In fact, a control arteriography performed 5 day after embolization showed a significant reduction of the size of the lesion. A MRI performed three months after the procedure evidenced the complete regression of the lesion.

{"data":"A 64-year-old gentleman with a post radiation recurrent squamous carcinoma of the left lower alveolus was posted for composite resection and reconstruction with fibula free flap by simultaneous two team approach. The left fibula was selected and after flap harvest, the left neck vessels (superior thyroid and facial) were assessed for the volume and character of the flow and were found to be good. The bone defect was extending from midline anteriorly to proximal ramus posteriorly and the soft-tissue defect was confined to the oral cavity []. The flap was designed in a manner so that the superior thyroid vessels were to be used as donor vessels as they were away from the previous zone of irradiation and the blood flow was also good after dissecting them and dividing to look for the volume and adequacy of blood flow. After osteotomy and preliminary intra oral in setting of the skin paddle, and during the time of anastomosis, it was found that the flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after initial good flow. Routine measures such as application of warm saline, xylocaine solution and later papaverine did not improve the flow and in such a situation, the options available were\nTo open the right neck and use vessels from that side either directly or with a vein graft To use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the same (left) side as the flow in this vessel was good To use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with left facial artery, so as to establish the vascular flow in a retrograde manner. This was because the clipped distal ends of the peroneal pedicle vessels were near to the left facial artery.\nBefore exploring the opposite neck or harvesting a vein graft, a decision was made to attempt retrograde vascularisation of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. First, the arterial anastomosis was completed between the distal end of the peroneal artery and left facial artery (end-to-end) and the flow was checked.

{"data":"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood.

{"data":"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis.

{"data":"A male patient aged 62 years reported to our center with the chief complaint of dull gnawing pain and a growth in the mouth [] of 5 years duration associated with difficulty in eating and swallowing. The history revealed that the patient had met with a road traffic accident 5 years back which resulted in injuries to his upper front teeth, lower lip, and left side of the face. A few months after the injury, he noticed a small growth on the left side of the upper gums that progressively increased slowly to the present size. There was a sudden surge in growth 20 days before presentation to our department after the patient removed a tooth fragment sticking to the growth. There was a gross asymmetry of face caused by the diffuse swelling involving the lower two-third of the left side of the face. Superoinferiorly, it extended from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and the anteroposterior extent was from the midline to the left preauricular region. The mass was reddish pale, exophytic with a lobulated surface, measuring approximately 10 cm \u00d7 6 cm and was protruding from the oral cavity causing inability to close the mouth. The growth was attached to the left maxillary alveolus and palate and not fixed to the buccal mucosa or vestibular sulcus. It did not show any focus of surface ulceration, but bleeding spots were distributed randomly. The upper posterior teeth were displaced and attached to the mass on the palatal side.

{"data":"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Hmm, I'm okay, just a little tired.\nDoctor: I see from your medical records that you have been a caregiver for your mother who had end-stage breast cancer.

We encountered some obstacles during home care, but together we were able to provide the care your mother needed.\nPatient: Yes, the home care staff was worried about whether my mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members.\nDoctor: They also mentioned that you were usually not present during their visits. Why was that?\nPatient: I was usually doing the dishes or other chores.\nDoctor: I see. Were you aware of your mother's medications or how her clothes were organized?\nPatient: Not really, I was focused on the dishes.\nDoctor: I understand. The home care staff had some distrust towards you, causing you stress. Did you feel that?\nPatient: Yes, it was difficult to communicate with them even when we talked.\nDoctor: That's understandable.

Did you know about this?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed, but I didn't want to let my parents know about it.\nDoctor: I understand. It must have been difficult for you to manage the home care schedule and chores while also dealing with your disorder.\nPatient: Yes, it was difficult at times.\nDoctor: Now that we know about your diagnosis, we can work together to make sure you have the support you need.

{"data":"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 \u00d7 109\/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity.

He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 \u00d7 109\/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered","conversation":"Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today?\nPatient: I presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.\nDoctor: I see, did you experience any sharp pain when you first developed the abnormality?\nPatient: Yes, I did.

{"data":"A 46-year-old female patient was admitted to our department due to a cystic tumor in pancreatic body and tail. Routine chemistry and tumor marker levels (CA 19-9, CEA, CA 125) were all within normal limits. Abdominal CT scan and EUS showed about 5\u00d74 cm sized, slightly septated cystic tumor between the body and tail of the pancreas (). There was no mural nodule, no calcification, and no eccentrically located mass within the cystic area. The benign mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was the most favorable preoperative diagnosis. The operation sequence was similar to usual laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy except trocar placement (). The robotic camera arm and other three instrument arms were then connected to their respective ports. At this point, the surgeon sat at the surgical console located about 3 m from the operating table. The assistant surgeon was positioned on the patient's left side for temporary use of laparoscopic instruments through Port 4. In spite of our previous experiences of robot surgical system, the cystic tumor and the remaining splenic vessels were so closely adherent that bleeding was frequently encountered, and most operation time was spent for this process. The risk of cyst rupture was also considered when we tried to separate and divide the small splenic vessels from pancreatic cyst (). Therefore, concomitant segmental resection of splenic vessels was thought to be necessary for spleen preservation. Total operation took about 480 minutes, and about 800 mL of blood loss was noted without blood transfusion. The specimen was delivered through the umbilical port site with small vertical incision after putting into the plastic bag. The patient recovered without complication. She returned to an oral diet on the postoperative second day. After the drain was removed, she was discharged on the fifth day post-operation. The final pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without any characteristics of malignant potential ().

He had full thickness burn wounds over the right scapula, right upper limb and anterior abdominal wall along with perforation of the intestine. There was prolapse of the intestinal loops through abdominal wound. Patient was referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days. He presented to us in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place.

Patient was initially managed conservatively with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound and culture specific antibiotics. Patient responded well to the conservative management and once he was stable, a thorough debridement of the necrotic skin over the right shoulder and upper arm was performed. The area was then split skin grafted. The patient developed enterocutaneous fistula, which healed over a period of 8 weeks. The wound over the abdomen was also covered with skin graft and patient was discharged after 18 days [].\nAbout 4 months after the discharge, the patient presented with ventral hernia and requested reconstruction of the abdominal wall.

And did you have any other symptoms besides the burn wounds?\n\nPatient: Yes, I also had a perforation of my intestine and there was prolapse of the intestinal loops through my abdominal wound.\n\nDoctor: Okay, that's a lot to deal with. So, you were referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days of initial management, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor: And when you presented to us, you were in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Do you remember what kind of management you received when you were admitted to the General surgery ward?\n\nPatient: No, I don't remember much. I just remember that they put in a catheter drain through my open abdominal wound.\n\nDoctor: Okay. When you were admitted to our plastic surgery unit, you had necrosis of burned skin and muscles over your right shoulder and abdomen, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: And you were initially managed with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound, and culture-specific antibiotics, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor: And you responded well to the conservative management, and once you were stable, we performed a thorough debridement of the necrotic skin over your right shoulder and upper arm, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: And after the debridement, we split skin grafted the area, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor: And you developed an enterocutaneous fistula, which healed over a period of 8 weeks, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: And the wound over your abdomen was covered with a skin graft, and you were discharged after 18 days, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: Alright. And now you're here today because you have a ventral hernia and you would like to have it reconstructed, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor: Okay. We plan to repair the ventral hernia by applying a synthetic mesh and reconstructing the abdominal wall with a flap cover, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: Alright. And during the operation, the abdominal skin graft was separated from the peritoneum and the underlying omentum, and an inlay composite mesh was applied to secure the abdominal wall, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: And after the flap failed, we debrided the area and applied two random pattern transposition skin flaps, one from the right upper abdomen and another from the left lower abdomen, is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\n","idx":165442,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Contact with high tension electric wire\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Open abdominal wound, full thickness burn wounds, perforation of the intestine, prolapse of the intestinal loops\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": \"Initially 3 days in general surgery ward, then referred to plastic surgery unit\",\n            \"center\": \"Initially general surgery ward, then plastic surgery unit\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"35\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": \"Farmer\",\n        \"occupation\": \"Farmer\"\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": None,\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Necrosis of burned skin and muscles over the right shoulder and abdomen, enterocutaneous fistula, ventral hernia\",\n            \"Type\": \"Debridement, split skin grafting, repair of ventral hernia by synthetic mesh application, reconstruction of the abdominal wall with flap cover\",\n            \"time\": \"Debridement and grafting after patient was stable; hernia repair and reconstruction 4 months after discharge\",\n            \"outcome\": \"Skin graft successful, enterocutaneous fistula healed over 8 weeks, ventral hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction with complications\",\n            \"details\": \"Initial grafting of right shoulder and upper arm, abdominal wound covered with skin graft, free tensor fascia lata flap failed, two random pattern transposition skin flaps used\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Septic shock\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": None,\n            \"time\": \"Presented in septic shock after 3 days of initial management\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Patient was in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place upon presentation to plastic surgery unit\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": None,\n            \"result\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": None,\n            \"severity\": None,\n            \"result\": None,\n            \"condition\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"treatments\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Conservative management\",\n            \"related condition\": \"Burn wounds, septic shock, abdominal wound\",\n            \"dosage\": None,\n            \"time\": \"Initially upon admission to plastic surgery unit\",\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"To stabilize the patient's condition\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": \"Patient responded well\",\n            \"details\": \"Intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound, culture specific antibiotics\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"discharge\": {\n        \"reason\": \"Stable condition and healing of wounds\",\n        \"referral\": None,\n        \"follow up\": None,\n        \"discharge summary\": \"Patient discharged after 18 days with healed wounds and stable condition\"\n    }\n}"}

{"data":"A previously healthy 73-year-old Caucasian female presents to the clinic with a history of progressive fatigue and dyspnea on exertion over the past couple of months. She denied angina, palpitations, syncope or any other associated symptoms and did not have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. On examination, she was stable and in no distress. Her blood pressure was 148\/66 mmHg with a regular pulse of 48 beats per minute. She had no clinical evidence of heart failure on cardiovascular examination but was found to have an S4 on auscultation and cannon A waves on assessment of her jugular venous pressure (JVP). Her exam was otherwise unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram during the clinic visit revealed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute with right bundle branch block morphology; her 12-lead electrocardiogram 3 months earlier also revealed evidence of underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm. Trans-thoracic echocardiography displayed normal left ventricular size and function with mild degenerative changes of the mitral and aortic valves consistent with age related changes. There was no laboratory evidence of any metabolic or ischemic etiologies for the conduction disease. Given her age, clinical presentation, underlying conduction disease in the setting of no significant structural abnormalities on echocardiography, and lack of significant comorbidities, the patient likely had age related degenerative conduction disease. Significant coronary artery disease could not be excluded but was very unlikely given the lack of ischemic symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk factors along with normal cardiac size and function. She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent.

We also did a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the visit and it showed that you have complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block.\n\nPatient: What does that mean?\n\nDoctor: It means that your heart is not beating normally and it's using a backup system to keep beating. This is called a junctional escape rhythm.\n\nPatient: Oh.\n\nDoctor: We also checked your electrocardiogram from 3 months ago and it showed that you have an underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm.\n\nPatient: I see.\n\nDoctor: We also did a Trans-thoracic echocardiography and it showed that your heart is normal in size and function, but you have some mild degenerative changes in your mitral and aortic valves, which is normal for your age.\n\nPatient: Hmm.\n\nDoctor: There was no evidence of any metabolic or ischemic problems in your lab results.

Just a little bit worried about this bulge in my right groin.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me more about your chief complaint?\n\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I\u2019ve had this bulge in my right groin for about 6 weeks now. At first, it was very painful, but it\u2019s been asymptomatic ever since. I\u2019m not sure what caused it.\n\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. Have you had any hernia repair in the past?\n\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I had a hernia repair in 1977, but I don\u2019t remember much about it. I don\u2019t think they used any mesh for the implantation.\n\nDoctor: Okay, let me take a look. Can you lie down on the bed, please?\n\nPatient: Sure, doctor.\n\nDoctor: (after physical examination) I found a 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm firm, nontender mass in your right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. I\u2019d like to perform a computed tomography scan of your abdomen and pelvis to see what\u2019s causing the mass.\n\nPatient: Okay, doctor.\n\nDoctor: (after the scan) The imaging showed that you have a right inguinal hernia and your appendix is inside the sac. Your laboratory test also showed a white blood cell count of 4.7 \u00d7 109\/L.\n\nPatient: Is that bad, doctor?\n\nDoctor: No, it\u2019s not necessarily bad. But we need to perform a surgical intervention to repair the hernia.\n\nPatient: Okay, doctor. I\u2019ll do it.\n\nDoctor: (on the day of the surgery) We\u2019ll make a classic oblique incision in your right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.\n\nPatient: Okay, doctor.\n\nDoctor: (after the surgery) The hernia was composed of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. We tried to reduce the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity, but the adhesions prevented it. So, we had to make a relaxing incision in the typical transverse fashion in your right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and entered the peritoneum.\n\nPatient: Is everything okay now, doctor?\n\nDoctor: Yes, the surgery was successful. We\u2019ll monitor you closely for the next few days. You may experience some discomfort or pain, but it should subside in a few days.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.\n\n","idx":7091,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Chief complaint of a right groin bulge present for 6 weeks\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Elective right inguinal hernia repair\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": \"Outpatient surgical setting\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"88 years old\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"Previously repaired right inguinal hernia from 1977, no mesh implantation\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac\",\n            \"Type\": \"Right inguinal hernia repair\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Classic oblique incision made in the right groin, external oblique aponeurosis opened, hernia isolated and examined, appendix could not be reduced due to chronic adhesions, relaxing incision made in the right lower quadrant\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Groin bulge\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": \"Sharp pain initially, then asymptomatic\",\n            \"location\": \"Right groin\",\n            \"time\": \"Present for 6 weeks\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Initially had sharp pain when the abnormality first developed\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Physical examination\",\n            \"result\": \"3 cm \u00d7 3 cm firm, nontender mass palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle\",\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis\",\n            \"severity\": None,\n            \"result\": \"Relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac\",\n            \"condition\": \"Right inguinal hernia\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Preoperative laboratory testing\",\n            \"severity\": None,\n            \"result\": \"White blood cell count of 4.7 \u00d7 109\/L\",\n            \"condition\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"treatments\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Surgical intervention\",\n            \"related condition\": \"Right inguinal hernia\",\n            \"dosage\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"To repair the hernia\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Patient elected to proceed with the surgery\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"discharge\": {\n        \"reason\": None,\n        \"referral\": None,\n        \"follow up\": None,\n        \"discharge summary\": None\n    }\n}"}

{"data":"A 40-year-old dominant right-handed male working in private insurance company with no significant medical history suffered a distal radius fracture of the left hand due to road traffic accident (). On clinical examination, he could move the fingers of the hand and there was no evidence of any neurovascular deficit distal to the injury. Crepitus could be felt in the distal part of the radius just proximal to wrist joint and movements around the wrist were painful and limited. There were no other associated injuries, and medical history was not significant for any medical illness. A clinical diagnosis of the fracture of lower end radius was made and radiographs were consistent with the clinical diagnosis. Radiographs showed a comminuted fracture of the distal third radius with intra-articular extension for which open reduction and internal fixation through a volar FCR approach was planned. He underwent the definitive treatment of open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures distal radius under regional anesthesia. We had planned to fix the distal radius fracture using the usual FCR approach using 3.5 mm distal end radius locking plate. We could not identify the absence of the FCR tendon preoperatively because of severe swelling of the distal forearm. The incision was made at its usual location and we identified one tendon in the superficial plane which we thought was FCR, but when we traced the tendon proximally it started thinning without any muscle belly and when traced distally to its attachment, it was confirmed to be tendon of palmaris longus (PL). We could not find any tendon between PL and the traced radial artery. At that stage, we realized that FCRL was absent in that patient. We wrongly identified the PL tendon as the FCR because it was the tendinous structure at the most radial location of the volar distal forearm.

{"data":"A fourty-year-old man with DEB diagnosed at the age of eight was admitted to the department of gastroenterology because of the dysphagia for two previous months. The diagnosis of DEB was established due to the presence of single blisters on the whole body since the sixth month of life. His sister was also diagnosed with DEB and had similar symptoms of the disease. To our knowledge, the presented patient and his sister are the oldest diagnosed with EB living in Poland. At the age of four the patient started experiencing heartburn occasionally. Five years later dysphagia appeared for the first time. It was an episodal and periodical ailment. He reported a deterioration of dysphagia at the age of nineteen; he mostly consumed liquids and soft consistency meals during that time. Nonetheless, the patient admitted that this esophageal discomfort still was not a constant one and there were time intervals without this ailment. In the past there were also episodes of mild esophageal bleeding. The only one endoscopic esophageal dilatation in this patient took place in 1997; a stenosis was located then approximately 18 cm from incisors. The performed procedure ameliorated swallowing difficulty.

The patient was hemodynamically stable and taken to computed tomography (CT) scanner for evaluation of arterial injury. The CT scan revealed direct cannulation of the aortic knob with the sheath. The patient was directly transferred by helicopter to our institution for higher level of vascular surgery care. The patient arrived intubated and sedated with the sheath in place in the left chest covered with a dressing and a left chest tube in place with 100cc of sanguinous output.\nThe patient was taken to the hybrid operating room in our facility. Bilateral percutaneous femoral access was obtained and a five French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery, and initially, a seven French sheath was placed in the left common femoral artery. We placed two proglide devices in the left access in standard preclose technique as this was our anticipated side of device deployment. At this point, a pigtail catheter was advanced into the ascending aorta and an arch aortogram was performed which demonstrated a direct cannulation of the aortic knob (). We elected to proceed to with stent graft placement to manage this injury as the patient\u2019s comorbidities and advanced age were prohibitive risks for open repair. Prior to the placement of an endoprosthesis, a cerebral angiogram was performed to identify cerebrovascular dominance. This demonstrated a dominant right vertebral artery and left vertebral atresia. There was adequate distance from the site of sheath insertion to the left subclavian artery, such that we felt we could achieve a seal without covering the left subclavian artery. Based on our preoperative measurement of our anticipated proximal and distal seal zones,","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Hmm, I'm feeling okay, doctor.\nDoctor: That's good to hear.

{"data":"A 40-year-old Asian woman who had been in her usual state of good health was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung during a regular medical checkup. The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient\u2019s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.\nFive years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging also revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed. The orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. They also found that the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal. During the clinical course (105 months), no significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were found, even with imaging examinations, including CT and MR imaging.

{"data":"A 84-year-old female was scheduled for bilateral total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis of both hips (). Medical history included chronic Hepatitis C virus infection with no other medical conditions reported. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first. 5 months after scheduling, the patient was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair, and new pelvis radiographs were taken (). Other causes of the rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed of bilateral RDO. Keeping in mind a possible septic etiology, despite there was no history of septicemia and inflammatory markers were elevated due to chronic hepatitis, we decided to take samples for microbiology and histology during the procedures. The right hip was performed through an anterior approach by a senior surgeon following standard antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin 20 min before skin incision. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. Femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum. This conditioned high and medial implantation of the cup to achieve stability. 4 days after the first procedure was performed, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. Synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria [] were not met and the patient did not receive antibiotic treatment. 6 days later, after a favorable post-operative evolution, the left hip was performed through a posterior approach by a different senior surgeon with the same hip system but with a cemented stem (). In the left hip, the acetabulum was also affected by the bone destruction, but the cup was able to be placed at a correct height. This ended up with a leg length discrepancy that is well tolerated by the patient taking into account her previous functional status. 5 days after the second procedure and following a post-operative period without complications","conversation":"\nDoctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm okay, thank you.\nDoctor: I see that you're here for a hip replacement.

The pacing leads and box were removed and the infection was treated with antibiotics.

Therefore he was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.\nA lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy (Figure ). The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle. Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall.

Can you describe the procedure that was performed?\n\nPatient: I had a lower half limited median sternotomy starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. And then a second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy. The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what was done with the leads?\n\nPatient: The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle.\n\nDoctor: And what about the left ventricle?\n\nPatient: Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall.\n\nDoctor: I see. And where was the pacing box inserted?\n\nPatient: It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box, which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle.\n\nDoctor: And what was done after that?\n\nPatient: The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. The pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into the pocket.\n\nDoctor: That's a lot of information. Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that's everything.\n\nDoctor: Alright. I'll make sure to include all of this information in your file. Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No, I think I'm good.\n\nDoctor: Great. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.

{"data":"At the time of diagnosis this patient was a 9 year-old female with a one year history of pain and swelling about her left knee. She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space.

She reported having an episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness after a period of 24 h without any neurological deficit with a complaint of neck rigidity and headache. The patient had a past history of similar episodes dating back 1 year. Upon interview she recalled a long history of trivial headaches, malaise and low grade fever for the past 6 years, whose severity had never warranted any further investigation. She also had a history of intermittent claudication in her bilateral upper limbs. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit, however, radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally. Right to left blood pressure discrepancies were detected, measuring at 140\/80 from right arm and 160\/80 from the left arm.\nA CT brain was conducted that revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension (). Similar findings were evident in previous CT scan brain which was done 1 year ago at the previous presentation of ictus (). Laboratory investigation showed raised ESR upto 40 mm\/h and C Reactive Protein was positive. Cerebral angiography and aortogram showed total occlusion of left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of right common carotid artery from its origin with slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering (). The sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation were bilateral vertebral arteries and showed saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm (). Additional imaging showed bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from their initial segments. There were extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms (). The terminal aorta was irregular but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of aorta were normal ().

{"data":"A 22 years old female patient reported to our department with a complaint of facial disfigurement on the left side of the face which gradually progressed over the past 14 years. Progressive atrophy on the left half of the face was initially noticed at the age of 8 years as an area of hyper pigmentation on the left malar area which gradually progressed with resultant atrophy of the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue resulting in the present disfigurement (Fig. ). However it was not associated with any other symptoms except for the limited mouth opening which the patient experienced gradually as the condition progressed. The patient had not sought any consultation earlier, for the facial disfigurement. Her medical and family history was non contributory. On general physical examination patient was conscious, oriented, a febrile, general condition was fair and vital signs were stable. Right side of the face appeared normal with marked facial asymmetry noted on left side. Head and neck examination confirmed the asymmetry with flattening, hyperpigmented, parchment like overlying skin. There was an evident loss of underlying fat, muscle and subcutaneous tissue giving a sunken in appearance. Thinning of the lips on the affected side with exposition of the teeth due to the corner of the mouth pulled to left side. Ocular examination and skin examination showed no abnormality with any evidence of lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of sensory or motor deficits on both sides. On palpation, the skin on the affected side was rigid with signs of sclerosis. TMJ on the affected side was tender with deviation to the left on mouth opening. Intraoral examination revealed normal moist mucosa but tense oral mucosa on the affected side. Tongue on the affected side showed marked atrophy on the left side with shift in the dorsal median fissure (Fig. ).

{"data":"The patient is a 58-year old male who was being evaluated for inguinal hernia repair. His past medical history included CAD with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery, diabetes with a HbA1c of 5.7 and an 80-pack year smoking history. He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates. He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (). This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis. With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD (). Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\nHe was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80\u201399% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50\u201379% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\nThe patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft.

We'll need to evaluate it further to determine what it is.\nPatient: Okay, what do I need to do?\nDoctor: We'll need to perform a CT scan to get a better look at the nodule.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: The results of your laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative, which is good. We also didn't find any abnormalities during your physical examination.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: However, the CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in your fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to biopsy both to determine what they are.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the biopsy samples were too small to make a definitive diagnosis. We suspect that there may be multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, so we'll need to observe you closely.\nPatient: Okay, I'll do whatever I need to do.\nDoctor: Five years later, your CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. We also found an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We'll need to perform video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion to evaluate both.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: During the surgery, the orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface.

{"data":"A 75-year-old man was seen in our orthopedic outpatient clinic with osteoarthritis of the right knee. He experienced morning stiffness, pain on the medial side of his right knee after walking and he had difficulties with full flexion of his knee. Conservative treatment was started with steroid infiltration, 4 cc lidocaine mixed with 1 cc depomedrol. Besides these complaints the patient reported a bilateral painless swollen calf muscle. The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.\nOn physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, the overlying skin appeared normal without deformities, erythema or warmth and the arterial pulsations were intact. Laboratory test results did not show any abnormalities. An X-ray did not show any bony irregularities in the tibia.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the legs revealed bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle (Figure ). There was no nidus seen on MRI so an arteriovenous form of the malformation was not plausible. Due to its asymptomatic presentation no angiogram or ultrasonography was performed to further specify the lesion. After consultation of the vascular surgeon we did not perform surgical resection or focal sclerotherapy because of the asymptomatic nature of the lesions.

{"data":"A 40-year-old Asian woman who had been in her usual state of good health was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung during a regular medical checkup. The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient\u2019s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.\nFive years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size.

{"data":"An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed at a local hospital a few days before visiting our hospital because the headache worsened and was not relieved through medication. Initial brain CT revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity (). Few calcified nodules were noted at the left frontotemporal cortex. However, it was initially considered a simple traumatic hemorrhage and was managed by conservative means. Several days later, the headache aggravated and the patient experienced an episode of generalized partial seizure. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed immediately after the seizure, the size of acute hematoma and cerebral edema was markedly increased, and a small enhancing mass was observed at the left cerebral convexity (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region (). Emergency craniotomy was performed to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma. A large craniotomy was done, and the subdural hematoma was removed by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision. While further opening of the dura, we were encountered by several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules which were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain (). Upon careful dissection, these nodules were noted to be buried in the sulcus while being severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries. Between the nodules was an organizing hematoma and upon careful removal, a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch was exposed. The involved MCA branch was carefully dissected and was trapped by clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm. The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised. The ischemic injury was minimized because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery.

I have been having a headache since I was tackled during exercise several weeks ago.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And what have you done so far to treat the headache?\nPatient: I went to a local hospital a few days ago and they did a Brain CT scan.\nDoctor: Okay, and what did the CT scan show?\nPatient: It showed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity and some calcified nodules at the left frontotemporal cortex.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's interesting. And what was the initial diagnosis for the headache?\nPatient: The initial diagnosis was a simple traumatic hemorrhage and I was managed by conservative means.\nDoctor: I see. And did the headache get better after that?\nPatient: No, several days later, the headache got worse and I had an episode of a generalized partial seizure.\nDoctor: Okay, and what did you do next?\nPatient: I was taken to the hospital again and they performed an MRI scan.\nDoctor: And what did the MRI scan show?\nPatient: The MRI scan showed that the size of the hematoma and cerebral edema had increased and there was a small enhancing mass at the left cerebral convexity.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's not good. And did they perform any other tests?\nPatient: Yes, they also did a Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) test.\nDoctor: And what did the MRA test show?\nPatient: The MRA test showed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region.\nDoctor: Okay, I see. And what was the next step?\nPatient: The next step was to perform an emergency craniotomy to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma.\nDoctor: And how was the craniotomy performed?\nPatient: They did a large craniotomy and removed the subdural hematoma by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's a lot of work. And what happened during the craniotomy?\nPatient: During the craniotomy, they encountered several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules that were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's not good. And what did they do with the nodules?\nPatient: They carefully dissected the nodules and found that they were buried in the sulcus and severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries.\nDoctor: And what happened after that?\nPatient: After that, they removed the organizing hematoma and exposed a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's serious. And what was the next step?\nPatient: The next step was to dissect the involved MCA branch and trap it with clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm.\nDoctor: And what happened to the aneurysm and the calcified nodules?\nPatient: The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised.\nDoctor: And how did the patient recover?\nPatient: The patient recovered without sequelae because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery and minimized the ischemic injury.\nDoctor: That's great news.

{"data":"An 82-year-old male presented with a large right IIA aneurysm diagnosed during routine surveillance on a long background history of complicated aortoiliac endovascular intervention. His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft. Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms. A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm. The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system. Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum. It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible. The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().\nThe decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation. Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery. The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch. Contrast injection in the angiography suite confirmed the catheter to be situated","conversation":"\nDoctor: Good morning, Mr. X.

{"data":"A 55-year-old female presented to the ophthalmology department of the hospital with complaints of a painful swelling in the left eye. The swelling had been gradually increasing in size over the last 8 months with dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area. There was progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months in the affected eye, and at the time of presentation in the hospital, the affected eye was completely blind. The progressive increase in the size of the swelling and pain in and around the eye compelled the patient to avail hospital services. The treatment history was not significant. The patient was being treated by a local doctor with eye drops and certain oral medicines the records of which were not available with her. She did not have any history of significant ocular disease or any ophthalmic surgery. There was no history of similar disease in the family.\nOn examination, an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye was visible. Axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball was seen. The underlying cornea was barely visible through the widened palpebral aperture with hyperemic keratinized conjunctiva tissue. The swelling was more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appeared stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball []. On palpation, the mass was tender and soft in consistency. Fundus examination was not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could also not be commented upon, even though it appeared slightly dilated. The patient had no perception of light in the left eye. Ophthalmological examination of the right eye did not show any abnormality both in the anterior as well as in posterior chamber.

{"data":"A 38 year old Vietnamese man was admitted with a 10 month history of epigastric pain, fatigue, 10 kg weight loss and recent onset jaundice. He had no other significant medical history. Clinical examination demonstrated anaemia and a tender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 7 \u00d7 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass adjacent to the second part of the duodenum, which contained fluid and air and abutted the hepatic flexure of the colon. The working diagnosis was a collection secondary to a colonic perforation and he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He improved with conservative management and was discharged a month later for outpatient colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed a lesion in the transverse colon, histology of which showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nHe subsequently returned to the Accident and Emergency Department following an upper gastrointestinal bleed. On his second admission, a repeat CT scan again suggested localised colonic perforation with formation of an abscess adjacent to the duodenum, along with thickening of the ascending colon, predominantly centred around the hepatic flexure. Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic uncertainty a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which revealed a large perforated tumour at the hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules. A laparotomy was performed via a transverse incision and following mobilisation of the hepatic flexure, a colonic tumour was found to have invaded the gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity anterior to the second part of the duodenum. At the base of the abscess cavity a large hole was apparent in the second part of the duodenum with malignant tumour invading the duodenum. Given the size of the defect (5 cm \u00d7 2 cm) and the presence of tumour it was not possible to resect and form a primary closure of the duodenum.

I was admitted to the hospital 10 months ago with a history of epigastric pain, fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Sure, I had a lot of pain in my upper stomach and I was very tired all the time. I also lost 10 kgs and my skin turned yellow.\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. And what happened during the Clinical examination?\nPatient: The examination showed that I was anemic and there was a tender mass in my right upper quadrant.\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any CT scan done?\nPatient: Yes, I did. The scan revealed a 7 \u00d7 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass near my duodenum. It contained fluid and air and was close to my colon.\nDoctor: Okay, and what was the working diagnosis?\nPatient: The doctors said it was a collection caused by a perforation in my colon. I was treated with antibiotics and improved with conservative management.\nDoctor: I see. And after that, what happened next?\nPatient: I was discharged after a month and had a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy showed a lesion in my transverse colon and the histology showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nDoctor: Okay. And then, did you come back to the hospital again?\nPatient: Yes, I did. I had an upper gastrointestinal bleed and came back to the Accident and Emergency Department.\nDoctor: I see. And what did the repeat CT scan show?\nPatient: The scan showed localised perforation in my colon with an abscess near my duodenum, and thickening in my ascending colon around my hepatic flexure.\nDoctor: Hmm. Given the presentation and diagnostic uncertainty, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The laparoscopy showed a large perforated tumour at my hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules.\nDoctor: I see. And then, what happened next?\nPatient: A laparotomy was performed through a transverse incision and the tumour was found to have invaded my gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity in front of the second part of my duodenum.\nDoctor: I see. And was it possible to resect the tumour and form a primary closure of the duodenum?\nPatient: No, it wasn't possible. The size of the hole was 5 cm \u00d7 2 cm and there was a lot of malignant tumour invading the duodenum.\nDoctor: I see. And what was done then?\nPatient: A right hemicolectomy was performed to remove as much of the tumour as possible and an ileotransverse anastamosis was formed.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the reason for that?\nPatient: Due to the extent of the disease and the associated abscess, the anterior wall couldn't be repaired.\nDoctor: I see. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you would like to ask me?\nPatient: No, I think that's all, doctor. Thank you for your time.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns in the future, don't hesitate to come back and see me.\n\n","idx":92709,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Recent onset jaundice and upper gastrointestinal bleed\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"10 month history of epigastric pain, fatigue, 10 kg weight loss, and recent onset jaundice\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": \"1 month\",\n            \"center\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Upper gastrointestinal bleed\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": \"Accident and Emergency Department\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"38\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": \"Vietnamese\",\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"No other significant medical history\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Large perforated tumour at the hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules\",\n            \"Type\": \"Right hemicolectomy and ileotransverse anastomosis\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": \"Debulking of the tumour\",\n            \"details\": \"Tumour had invaded the gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity anterior to the second part of the duodenum.

{"data":"An African American male in his 50s presented with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and orthopnea. He has a past medical history of coronary artery disease with multiple myocardial infarctions and two coronary stents placed in 2003 and two additional coronary stents placed two months prior to his admission. He had a history of systolic heart failure with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20%. In the emergency department atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted with a heart rate of 140. A diltiazem infusion was started and he was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Repeat echocardiogram several days later showed progressive worsening of his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 18%. He was started on inotropic support and underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to assist with hemodynamic stability. Approximately 24 hours later the patient had an episode of melena associated with a drop in his hemoglobin from 10.1 to 7.7. He was started on proton pump inhibitor infusion. He underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus compatible with gastritis as well as grade 1 reflux esophagitis but no evidence of active bleeding. A Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was found to be negative. A colonoscopy was performed after hemodynamic stabilization for further evaluation of melena and pretransplant screen. This was positive for abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon suggestive of ischemic colitis which was later confirmed by biopsy (). Given the unusual involvement of nonwatershed areas such as the cecum and ascending colon, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to evaluate the celiac and mesenteric vasculature. There was no significant narrowing of either vessel noted on the CT; however the inferior metallic marker of the IABP was found to be inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery ().

{"data":"A 30-year-old woman was admitted to our institution in June 2002 for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk. A giant ICA aneurysm had been found during a previous evaluation of abducens nerve palsy on her right side in November 2001 (). At that time, a tortuous basilar artery had been found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation (). She had undergone endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital (). However, she developed severe headache seven months after the treatment. At the time of admission, she complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area. Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities. On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem (). Cerebral angiography showed a fusiform giant aneurysm, with an irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk (). The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. In addition, another de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.\nTo relieve the brain stem compression, we decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention. In advance of performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft. This is because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since the patient had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA. The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory (), and an adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA).

And why was the bypass performed?\nPatient: This was because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since I had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA.\nDoctor: I see. And what did the bypass supply?\nPatient: The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened to the blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation?\nPatient: An adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA).\nDoctor: I understand. And what happened during surgery?\nPatient: During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned.\nDoctor: I see. Thank you for explaining to me. I will take a look at your file and get back to you with the follow-up plan.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.\n\n","idx":125659,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Severe headache and progressive dyspnea\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk\",\n            \"date\": \"June 2002\",\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"30\",\n        \"sex\": \"Woman\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"Previous evaluation of abducens nerve palsy, endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"To relieve brain stem compression and to maintain adequate blood supply to the posterior circulation\",\n            \"Type\": \"High-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery using a saphenous vein graft\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since the patient had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Severe headache\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": \"Severe\",\n            \"location\": None,\n            \"time\": \"Seven months after the treatment\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Developed seven months after endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Progressive dyspnea\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": None,\n            \"time\": \"At the time of admission\",\n            \"temporalisation\": \"Progressive\",\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Dull headache\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": \"Dull\",\n            \"location\": \"Occipital area\",\n            \"time\": \"At the time of admission\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Neurologic examination\",\n            \"result\": \"6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities\",\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MR imaging\",\n            \"severity\": \"Giant aneurysm\",\n            \"result\": \"Aneurysm compressing the brain stem\",\n            \"condition\": \"Giant aneurysm of the basilar artery\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cerebral angiography\",\n            \"severity\": \"Fusiform giant aneurysm\",\n            \"result\": \"Irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk\",\n            \"condition\": \"Fusiform giant aneurysm of the basilar trunk\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": \"The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm.

And did you have any more episodes of seizures after that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had intermittent episodes of seizures when I was 9 years old.\n\nDoctor: And what did we do for you then?\n\nPatient: You did another MRI and it showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan, and some abnormal vessels on T2 weighted image. And then you did an MR angiogram which showed an arteriovenous malformation.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what did we advise you to do at that time?\n\nPatient: You advised me to have surgery, but my parents were not willing since I only had intermittent seizures.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. And did you have any more follow-up visits after that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I came back a year later with intractable seizures. And you did a digital substraction angiography which showed the arteriovenous malformation.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. And what did we do for you then?\n\nPatient: You operated on me and resected the arteriovenous malformation.\n\nDoctor: Okay, I see. Thank you for sharing your history with me. Is there anything else you would like to tell me about your condition?\n\nPatient: No, that's all.\n\nDoctor: Alright. I will need to examine you and do some tests to see if there's anything else we need to do. Can you come back for a follow-up visit in a month?\n\nPatient: Sure, I will come back.\n\nDoctor: Great. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.\n\n","idx":117356,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Intermittent episodes of seizures

{"data":"A 34 year old Persian woman, gravida 1, para 0, presented at 22 weeks of pregnancy with a two week history of left hip pain with no apparent precipitating event. Her past medical history included mild Multiple Sclerosis from which she was asymptomatic. She did not smoke or drink alcohol, had no history of corticosteroid, anticonvulsant or anticoagulant use and was not on any other medication. Clinical examination was unremarkable and no investigations were deemed appropriate. The working diagnosis at this stage was non-specific hip pain related to pregnancy and supportive measures were instituted.\nOver the following 12 weeks her hip pain worsened, and she started to experience pain in the contra lateral hip. Again there was no history of a traumatic event. Because of her pregnancy imaging of her hips was avoided. By 36 weeks of pregnancy she was unable to weight bear and became wheelchair bound. Pain in her hips and limitation of motion meant that a normal vaginal delivery was impossible; hence she underwent a caesarean delivery of a healthy baby at full term.\nShe was brought to the attention of the orthopaedic team when plain radiographs (see figure ) following delivery revealed a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the left and a valgus impacted right intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the right. The radiographs also revealed considerable osteopaenia. MRI (see figure ) revealed these fractures, with reduced signal on T1 and increased signal on T2 in the femoral necks in keeping with TOP.\nShe underwent closed reduction and internal fixation of the left hip. The right hip was internally fixed in situ. Two hole 135 degree dynamic hip screws were used in order to provide sufficient stability to allow immediate mobilisation despite bilateral fractures. Difficulty was encountered in ensuring that the threads of the dynamic hip screw had crossed the fracture site in the left hip as the level of the fracture was high in the femoral neck, consequently the tip of the implant had to be implanted close to the subchondral plate (see figure ).\nThe post","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?\nPatient: Hello, I'm here because I have been having pain in my left hip for a few weeks now.\nDoctor: I see.

While reviewing the history, it became obvious that the patient had not been well for the previous four weeks prior to admission. She had a low grade pyrexia and mildly raised inflammatory markers with associated anaemia and thrombocytopenia.

It was a large mobile mass measuring about 11 \u00d7 4 mm and prolapsing in to the left ventricular outflow tract with mild aortic regurgitation (). She was then treated for infective endocarditis with intravenous antibiotics. Despite therapy she continued to have an intermittent fever with persistent raised inflammatory markers.

{"data":"A 40-year-old man presented with fresh hemorrhagic stool. Colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed, but the bleeding site was not clear in the visible range of the stomach, duodenum, and colon. On hospital day 2, capsule endoscopy was performed, and bleeding from the small intestine was detected. On hospital day 3, the patient developed shock due to massive bleeding. Hence, emergency transcatheter arterial embolization was performed. He had a history of surgery for anal atresia and small bowel stoma as a neonate, and he required hemodialysis because of chronic renal failure with bilateral kidney malformations. Computed tomography performed before transcatheter arterial embolization showed that the anatomy of the left common iliac artery was normal. However, the right external iliac artery was defective. Blood from the right common iliac artery flowed directly into a traveling vessel: the internal iliac artery. The blood vessel descended at an acute angle to the pelvic floor, and then, it rose and flowed into the femoral artery (Fig. ). We chose to insert the catheter from the left femoral artery and then further selectively advanced the catheter to the superior mesenteric artery, which is the responsible vessel for gastrointestinal bleeding. Regarding the superior mesenteric artery, the branch from the aorta was at the same level as the celiac artery, and the right hepatic artery originated from the superior mesenteric artery. But angiography did not show a clear extravasation from either branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Small intestinal endoscopy was performed on hospital day 8. However, it was impossible to advance the endoscope because the small intestinal adhesion was very strong. Thereafter, there was no massive bleeding. He was discharged home on hospital day 20 after red blood cell transfusion. Later, he was hospitalized again for small intestinal resection. In the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was firmly adhered. First, 30 cm of the adhered small intestine was resected. Then, small intestinal endoscopy was performed through the small bowel stump. There were two diverticula on the oral side, but no obvious bleeding was found.

{"data":"The patient is a male in his 60s with a past medical history significant for pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was referred to neurology clinic for progressive, bilateral, lower extremity numbness which he noted first in his feet. The patient indicated the pain and tingling in his feet worsened with prolonged standing and walking. He also endorsed lower back pain on follow-up visits. MRI of the thoracic cord demonstrated a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. The initial workup was unrevealing for an etiology and initial suspicions were that his condition was due to neurosarcoidosis. A lumbar puncture was performed and negative. Upon further review of the spinal imaging it was thought that there may be dilatation of the spinal epidural venous plexus, which would potentially indicate a dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient was then taken for a catheter angiogram for further evaluation.\nDuring angiography, the left and right subclavian arteries were imaged to evaluate for spinal cord blood flow. An injection within the aorta was required to establish a road map for the left vertebral artery and the left vertebral artery origin from the aortic arch was found. An injection of the aortic arch origin of the vertebral artery revealed complete filling of all segments of the left vertebral artery. Retrograde filling of the left subclavian artery was seen indicating a potential dual origin from the left subclavian artery. A catheter was placed within the left subclavian and a second origin of the left vertebral artery was appreciated to originate and merge with the aortic V1 segment at the level of the C5 vertebrae (Figure ). Equal filling was seen from both the aortic and subclavian origin. No aneurysms or dissections were appreciated in either origin or at the confluence. When the right T7 spinal artery was injected, a dAVF was observed. The fistula originated from a distal branch of the spinal artery and combined with an anterior spinal vein with abnormal filling appreciated. The rest of the spinal arteries were interrogated and noted to be grossly normal without aneurysms, fistulas, or other vascular abnormalities.\nPost","conversation":"Doctor: Hi, my name is Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm okay, thank you.\nDoctor: I understand you were referred to our neurology clinic. Can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?\nPatient: Yes, I have a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis.\nDoctor: Okay, and what brought you to our clinic today?\nPatient: I've been experiencing progressive, bilateral, lower extremity numbness that started in my feet.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. Can you describe the pain and tingling you've been experiencing in your feet?\nPatient: It gets worse when I stand or walk for a long time.\nDoctor: Alright, and have you noticed any lower back pain as well?\nPatient: Yes, I have.\nDoctor: Okay, let's take a look at your MRI results. It says here that an MRI of your thoracic cord demonstrated a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And the initial workup was negative for an etiology, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: And because of that, we suspected that your condition might be due to neurosarcoidosis.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: Alright, so we performed a lumbar puncture, but that came back negative. But after reviewing your spinal imaging, we thought that there may be dilatation of your spinal epidural venous plexus, which would indicate a dural arteriovenous fistula.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: That's why we took you for a catheter angiogram for further evaluation. During the angiography, we imaged your left and right subclavian arteries to evaluate your spinal cord blood flow.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: And an injection was required within your aorta to establish a road map for your left vertebral artery. And we found that the left vertebral artery originates from your aortic arch.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: And when we injected the aortic arch origin of your vertebral artery, we saw complete filling of all segments of your left vertebral artery.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: And there was also retrograde filling of your left subclavian artery, indicating a potential dual origin from your left subclavian artery.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: So we placed a catheter within your left subclavian and we saw a second origin of your left vertebral artery, which merged with your aortic V1 segment at the level of your C5 vertebrae.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: And equal filling was seen from both the aortic and subclavian origin.

{"data":"A 54-year-old female, who was found to have incidental giant left ICA aneurysm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, during the workup for headaches (). There was no history of thunderclap headache or any associated visual or neurologic symptoms to suggest aneurysm rupture. Initial angiogram for evaluation of aneurysm, demonstrated a large left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm, measuring around 26\u00d719 mm with a wide neck of 14 mm (). There was a patent anterior communicating artery with brisk cross filling of the left cerebral vasculature from the contralateral right side as well as patent left PCOM artery. Considering the complex anatomy, size of aneurysm and presence of good collaterals with patent anterior and PCOM artery, a plan was made in another hospital to treat the aneurysm with parent vessel occlusion rather than flow diverter stent. Subsequently, the aneurysm was treated in October 2016. Initially, a balloon occlusion test of the left ICA was performed which was negative for any neurological change during 20 minutes of balloon occlusion with blood pressure challenge as well. Subsequently, occlusion of the left ICA proximal to the aneurysm was performed using multiple coils (, ). There was no antegrade flow into the left ICA after occlusion with a patent flow into the left cerebral hemisphere through a patent anterior and PCOM arteries (, ). Angiogram of the left vertebral artery after occlusion of left ICA showed retrograde filling of the left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm (, ). This was considered to occlude overtime considering the competing antegrade intracranial flow. Patient remained asymptomatic after the treatment. Follow up angiogram after 6 months and 2 years demonstrated no antegrade flow in the left ICA, however there was persistent filling of the left ICA aneurysm in a retrograde fashion through the PCOM artery (). The aneurysm was followed up for another year and showed no evidence of occlusion with similar retrograde filling through the PCOM artery with no much change in its size. At this stage, considering the persistent filling of aneurysm, treatment was contemplated and the patient was transferred to our institution","conversation":"\nDoctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, thank you.\n\nDoctor: I understand you have been having headaches.

{"data":"A 51-year-old hypertensive Pakistani male patient was admitted in the cardiac intensive care unit in King Fahd University Hospital on 30 July 2017 complaining of chest and back pain for two weeks prior to the presentation; he took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but were not effective. Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively ().

I am feeling much better now.\nDoctor: I am glad to hear that. Can you tell me about the chest and back pain that brought you here?\nPatient: I had been experiencing it for two weeks prior to my presentation.\nDoctor: Did you take any medication for it?\nPatient: Yes, I took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but they were not effective.\nDoctor: I see. During the physical examination, we found that your vital signs were stable. How were you feeling at that time?\nPatient: I was conscious and moving all my limbs.\nDoctor: That's great. The CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down to the level of renal arteries. It also showed enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with a large aneurysmal dilatation and a compression of the true lumen. Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. \nPatient: Oh my, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it was. However, we underwent thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after your first day of admission. It was done through the right femoral approach, and a stent graft was used. The intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated.\nPatient: I see. Did the procedure go well?\nDoctor: Yes, it did. A postdeployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries.\nPatient: That's good news. How long do I need to stay here in the intensive care unit?\nDoctor: You were discharged one day after the surgery and were doing well afterward. We have evaluated your prognosis and will instruct you on follow-up requirements. \nPatient: Thank you, doctor. What should I do next?\nDoctor: We will give you instructions on postoperative care and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your condition.","idx":184410,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Presented with chief complaints of dyspnea\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": None,\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"60\",\n        \"sex\": \"female\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": \"laborer\"\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"diagnosed case of carcinoma lung with metastasis\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"massive pleural effusion\",\n            \"Type\": \"indwelling intercostal tube insertion\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": \"A newer economical technique was employed on the lines of indwelling pleural catheter.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"dyspnea\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"massive pleural effusion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"ultrasonography\",\n            \"result\": \"used to mark the site of icd insertion\",\n            \"details\": \"The site of icd insertion site was marked by ultrasonography in the mid axillary line.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": None,\n            \"severity\": None,\n            \"result\": None,\n            \"condition\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"treatments\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"thoracoscopy and talc poudrage\",\n            \"related condition\": \"massive pleural effusion\",\n            \"dosage\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"to treat massive pleural effusion\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": \"patient refused\",\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"indwelling intercostal tube insertion\",\n            \"related condition\": \"massive pleural effusion\",\n            \"dosage\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"as an alternative to thoracoscopy and talc poudrage which the patient refused\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": \"allowed the patient to be mobile without any need for carrying the icd bag continuously and remained comfortable with the tube\",\n            \"details\": \"A newer economical technique was employed on the lines of indwelling pleural catheter.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"discharge\": {\n        \"reason\": None,\n        \"referral\": None,\n        \"follow up\": None,\n        \"discharge summary\": None\n    }\n}"}

And can you describe the swelling for me?\n\nPatient: It's about 6 cm long and 5 cm wide. It's mobile on the transverse axis, but not on the longitudinal axis.\n\nDoctor: And is there any motor weakness in your hand?\n\nPatient: No, there's no motor weakness.\n\nDoctor: That's good. And is there any protective sensation present in your hand?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have normal protective sensation.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And when I tap over the nerve, do you feel any tingling or numbness?\n\nPatient: Yes, it produces a positive Tinel's sign.\n\nDoctor: I see. And is there any family history of neurofibromatosis?\n\nPatient: No, there's no family history of neurofibromatosis.\n\nDoctor: Alright. We did an ultrasound, and it showed that the mass is subcutaneous, limited, and homogeneous, measuring 6 cm in diameter. However, the patient refused to undergo MRI examination due to financial constraints.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Based on the information we have, I have a clinical diagnosis of median nerve tumor. I'm planning to perform an excision of the tumor.\n\nPatient: Okay, what does that mean?\n\nDoctor: It means that I'll be removing the tumor from your forearm. But there's a chance that you may experience a neurological deficit following the surgery, and you may need a sural nerve graft.\n\nPatient: I see.\n\nDoctor: And we'll be performing the surgery under a supraclavicular block with bupivacaine and Xylocaine, under tourniquet control.\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nDoctor: And during the surgery, we'll be exploring the nerve and removing the tumor. It's well encapsulated and placed in an eccentric position to the axis of the nerve. We'll be using microsurgical techniques to gently resect the tumor.\n\nPatient: Okay, got it.\n\nDoctor: And after the surgery, we'll send the specimen for histopathological examination. The examination revealed typical features of schwannoma, with the presence of spindle cells forming Verocay bodies and clearly identified Antony A and B areas.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: And at your two-month follow-up, you were symptom-free with mild paresthesia in your index and middle fingers. There was no motor deficit or pain, and no recurrence of the tumor.\n\nPatient: That's great!\n\nDoctor: Yes, it is. And I'll see you in another two months for a follow-up appointment.\n\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor.\n\n","idx":113712,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Reconstruction of the right leg stump with anterolateral thigh flap\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Below knee amputation stump breakdown and extreme sensitivity and pain\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": \"16th postoperative day\",\n            \"center\": \"local hospital\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"32\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": \"School teacher\"\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"Below knee amputation done five years ago due to injury sustained in a road traffic accident\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Injury to right leg in a road traffic accident\",\n            \"Type\": \"Below knee amputation, followed by reconstruction with anterolateral thigh flap\",\n            \"time\": \"Surgery for reconstruction planned, duration of operation was six hours\",\n            \"outcome\": \"Postoperative period was uneventful, and skin grafted donor site healed satisfactorily\",\n            \"details\": \"Stump healed with secondary intention due to insufficient soft tissue cover and infection, repeated breakdown of loading area of stump, extreme sensitivity and pain, unable to bear weight.

On auscultation, the heart sounds were audible without any adventitious sounds. The breath sounds were diminished in the left lower chest. A chest x-ray was done which revealed multiple rib fracture with mediastinal widening and left pleural effusion. In view of excruciating chest and back pain with features of hemorrhagic shock, a suspicion of aortic injury was made and hence an urgent emergency department CT scan was done after that the patient was shifted quickly to the emergency operation theater without waiting for the reports and the CT film. While shifting to the operation theater the film was obtained on the operation theater console which revealed a contained ruptured aortic rupture immediately below the level of isthmus (). An intervention cardiologist opinion was sought for endovascular stenting but in view of lacerated aorta involving more than 50% of its circumference at the site of injury, it was not possible and hence an urgent open surgical technique was advised. The patient was taken to operation theatre and intubated with single lung tube. He was positioned in right lateral position. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was done and the chest cavity was entered through the fifth intercostal space. A huge contained hematoma was noted.

{"data":"A 44-year-old Caucasian female referred to the ER with acute abdominal pain. Past medical history revealed no family history of colon cancer and no history of smoke. At the admission, physical examination revealed pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no signs of bowel obstruction, mimicking an acute appendicitis. Laboratory investigation has not shown important pathological signs. Ultrasonography examination of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with normal bile ducts, no pathologies affecting the pancreas and neither free fluid, nor signs of acute appendicitis. In consideration of the clinical status of the patient and the persistent acute abdominal pain even with a negative ultrasound, a CT scan was performed to better comprehend the nature of the underling pathology. CT scan was performed four hours after the hospital admission, and demonstrated a thickened cecal wall with a small number of pathological nearby lymph nodes, confirming the absence of peritoneal free fluid. Given the absence of radiological signs of GI perforations and of other surgical and medical emergencies, we decided to perform a colonoscopy to better understand the etiology of the underling pathology. Colonoscopy was performed 24 hours after the hospital admission and after an adequate bowel preparation and revealed a massive, ulcerated, stenotic and necrotic lesion that involved the caecum and the right colon. Biopsies of the lesion were performed and the microscopic examination showed a cell proliferation composed by large, pleomorphic cellular elements with vesicular nuclei, hyperchromatic nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm, mixed with necrotic tissue. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma ().\nFor these reasons, a laparoscopic right colectomy in an elective setting was performed, together with an accurate lymphadenectomy. Surgical exploration of the abdominal cavity confirmed the absence of peritoneal carcinosis and distant metastasis. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an ulcerated lesion of the right colon with a 6 cm diameter, composed of a whitish and compact tissue, with hard consistency and infiltrative margins that extended to the perivisceral adipose tissue.

An ultrasound was performed and it showed a contracted gallbladder with normal bile ducts, no pathologies affecting the pancreas and neither free fluid nor signs of acute appendicitis.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: However, considering the persistent pain and the negative ultrasound results, we decided to perform a CT scan to better understand the nature of the underlying pathology.\n\nPatient: Okay, I see.\n\nDoctor: The CT scan was performed four hours after your admission and it demonstrated a thickened cecal wall with a small number of pathological nearby lymph nodes, confirming the absence of peritoneal free fluid.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: Given the absence of radiological signs of GI perforations and other surgical and medical emergencies, we decided to perform a colonoscopy to better understand the etiology of the underlying pathology.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n\nDoctor: The colonoscopy was performed 24 hours after your admission and after an adequate bowel preparation and it revealed a massive, ulcerated, stenotic, and necrotic lesion that involved the caecum and the right colon.\n\nPatient: Oh no.\n\nDoctor: Biopsies of the lesion were performed and the microscopic examination showed a cell proliferation composed of large, pleomorphic cellular elements with vesicular nuclei, hyperchromatic nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm, mixed with necrotic tissue. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\nPatient: Oh my God.\n\nDoctor: In light of these findings, a laparoscopic right colectomy in an elective setting was performed, together with an accurate lymphadenectomy.\n\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\n\nDoctor: It means that we performed a surgical procedure to remove the right colon and the surrounding lymph nodes.\n\nPatient: I see.\n\nDoctor: Surgical exploration of the abdominal cavity confirmed the absence of peritoneal carcinosis and distant metastasis.\n\nPatient: That's good to hear.\n\nDoctor: The pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an ulcerated lesion of the right colon with a 6 cm diameter, composed of a whitish and compact tissue, with hard consistency and infiltrative margins that extended to the perivisceral adipose tissue. Microscopic examination discovered a poorly differentiated neoplastic epithelial tumor, rich in mitosis.\n\nPatient: What happens next, doctor?\n\nDoctor: We will need to monitor your progress and schedule follow-up appointments to ensure that you are recovering well. We will also need to discuss further treatment options with you.\n\n","idx":117050,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Severe acute upper abdominal pain\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Severe acute upper abdominal pain, marked leukocytosis, severe anemia, and high blood glucose levels\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": \"Emergency department\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"86\",\n        \"sex\": \"Female\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, omphalocele repair (20 years prior), pancreatic serous cystadenoma (diagnosed 10 years earlier)\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Omphalocele\",\n            \"Type\": \"Omphalocele repair\",\n            \"time\": \"20 years before\",\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Upper abdominal pain\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": \"Severe\",\n            \"location\": \"Upper abdomen\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"temporalisation\": \"Acute\",\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Chest and abdominal x-rays\",\n            \"result\": \"Inconclusive\",\n            \"details\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Routine laboratory studies\",\n            \"result\": \"Marked leukocytosis, severe anemia, and blood glucose levels exceeding 500 mg\/dl\",\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Intravenous contrast CT scan\",\n            \"severity\": None,\n            \"result\": \"Large amount of free peritoneal air and free fluid, a left upper quadrant 17 cm large mass originating from the stomach, secondary liver lesions\",\n            \"condition\": \"Prepyloric ulcer perforation, large inoperable mass arising from the pancreatic body, multiple hepatic secondary lesions\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"treatments\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Laparotomy\",\n            \"related condition\": \"Prepyloric ulcer perforation, large inoperable pancreatic mass, multiple hepatic secondary lesions\",\n            \"dosage\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"To address the stomach perforation and assess the pancreatic mass\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": \"Stomach perforation sutured closed, washout performed, liver biopsy taken\",\n            \"details\": \"Histopathologic findings were consistent with serous microcystic adenoma of the pancreas; malignant nature confirmed by extensive invasive large inoperable pancreatic mass with hepatic secondary lesions\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"discharge\": {\n        \"reason\": None,\n        \"referral\": None,\n        \"follow up\": None,\n        \"discharge summary\": None\n    }\n}"}

Two coordinates of X-ray chest revealed the presence of foreign body in the (R) hemithorax, we suspected that the foreign body could be in the thoracoabdominal cavity based on the mechanism of injury. CT scan confirmed our suspicion that a sharp foreign body was indeed in the (R) thoracic cavity, not close to major vessels. There was a minimal pneumothorax which was not evident clinically. This sharp foreign body mandated removal. We decided to try minimal access surgery but with full preparations for open thoracotomy in case of failure. He needed one lung ventilation as a prerequisite for thoracoscopy. Hence the procedure was done under general anesthesia and intubated with a double lumen tube. He was placed on the anterolateral right thoracotomy position. Single lung ventilation was instituted.

In addition, CO2 insufflation was given up to 5mm Hg for safer initial trocar placement and better visualization of the hemithorax.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: A 10mm camera port was placed in the right 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. A 5 mm working port was placed in the same intercostal space. The foreign body was seen on the inferior surface of the lung and removed through the 10 mm port. The rest of the thoracic cavity and diaphragm were found to be normal.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. An intercostal tube was placed in the 10 mm port site. You had no adverse event intraoperatively and promptly recovered from anesthesia, with a well-expanded lung that was confirmed clinically and with a bedside X-ray.\nPatient: That's great.\nDoctor: However, we continued to ventilate you electively for 18 hours as our experience with one lung ventilation is limited.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: You were extubated and the ICD was removed the same day. You were discharged on the second postoperative day.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: And we'll be following up with you regularly. Is there anything else you would like to know or ask?\nPatient: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome! If you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask.

{"data":"The third patient, a 23-year-old woman with recurrent severe depression (see under results Case 3) experienced a prolonged seizure, which was stopped by intravenous application of benzodiazepine. This event mirrored the AEs, which required medical action by a doctor as reported in Case 2.\nThe young lady was a patient with an unusually high health risk for her age because of being obese and suffering from diabetes. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy reached discordant conclusions. However, it has been reported that metabolic abnormalities, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, may increase the prevalence of epilepsy (). In this line, there are data-driven considerations that mechanisms for the comorbidity of obesity and epilepsy are mitochondrial dysfunction and adiponectin deficiency, which promote epilepsy, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus (). While fundamental mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy remain a matter of discussion, hypoglycemia is an accepted reason for the occurrence of seizures in young patients with epilepsy (). The ECT patient reported here showed elevated blood sugar levels. However, a decline in the blood sugar level during the previous night and due to the ban of breakfast before ECT, which was applied in the early morning hours, could not be ruled out. While the occurrence of a prolonged seizure after the reduction of blood and brain sugar glucose level would be a possible explanation for our patient\u2019s AE, its probability appears to be low. Epileptic seizures with changes in the blood sugar level are rare and not as common as previously assumed and require significant hypoglycemia to occur ().\nThe patient did not show any changes in her respiratory function during ECT despite being overweight. Her obesity might have been a risk factor for altered respiration, in particular when being related to upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS; ).

While the fundamental mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy remain a matter of discussion, hypoglycemia is an accepted reason for the occurrence of seizures in young patients with epilepsy.\n\nPatient: I see.\n\nDoctor: During your ECT, your blood sugar levels were elevated, but a decline in the blood sugar level during the previous night and due to the ban of breakfast before ECT could not be ruled out.\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\n\nDoctor: While the occurrence of a prolonged seizure after the reduction of blood and brain sugar glucose level would be a possible explanation for your AE, its probability appears to be low. Epileptic seizures with changes in the blood sugar level are rare and not as common as previously assumed and require significant hypoglycemia to occur.\n\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n\nDoctor: I also noticed that you did not show any changes in your respiratory function during ECT despite being overweight.\n\nPatient: That's correct.\n\nDoctor: Your obesity might have been a risk factor for altered respiration, in particular when related to upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea syndrome. SAS is well known to increase the risk of anesthesia-related AEs, in particular when spontaneous breathing is needed during intravenous anesthesia.\n\nPatient: Yes, I have heard about that.\n\nDoctor: However, no sleep-related respiratory disorder was present in you despite being obese.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor: I would like to monitor your condition closely and I will need you to come back for a follow-up appointment next week.\n\nPatient: Okay, I will do that.\n\nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask or discuss with me?\n\nPatient: No, I think that's all.

{"data":"A 57-year-old male with stage IV metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma who had completed a full course of chemotherapy and localized esophageal radiation about 6 months before, presented with complaints of left-sided facial pain for 3 months. The patient's pain had been progressively worsening and was significant during his chewing of solid foods, resulting in weight loss interpreted as a result of poor oral intake. The pain was described as sharp, lancinating, and throbbing, radiating to the left temple and cheek. The patient rated the severity of the facial pain as 8 out of 10 on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale.\nThe workup prior to his visit included a brain MRI and a maxillofacial CT that focused on the trigeminal nerve distribution in the brain, and facial sinuses identified no neural element involvement, metastases or bony lesions. A PET scan of the entire body at an outside hospital showed a hypermetabolic mass in the distal esophagus consistent with known adenocarcinoma.\nWith the prior diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, the patient had been on methadone, hydrocodone, and carbamazepine, prescribed by other providers. This combination of medications had failed to improve the pain severity. He was then referred to the center of pain management with the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and continuing intractable facial pain.\nOn physical examination, the patient was in considerable distress due to the facial pain. He had a palpable trigger point over the left masseter muscle. The temporomandibular joint range of motion was within normal limits and with no associated pain. A sensory examination revealed a decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left chin, the lower lip, and the lower oral mucosa, consistent with the distribution of the left inferior alveolar nerve. There was no facial asymmetry, and no other cranial nerve deficits were observed. We decided to perform a localized mandibular CT scan, on which we localized a metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone with the involvement of the inferior alveolar nerve (fig. ).\nBased on this new imaging, we reviewed his prior maxillofacial CT and PET scans.

Can you tell me more about the pain?\n\nPatient: The pain is sharp, lancinating, and throbbing. It radiates to my left temple and cheek. And it's really bad when I chew solid foods.\n\nDoctor: I understand. And how would you rate the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst?\n\nPatient: I would say it's an 8.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And have you noticed any weight loss or changes in your oral intake?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have lost weight because I can't eat solid foods properly.\n\nDoctor: I see. And have you had any tests done prior to this visit?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had a brain MRI and a maxillofacial CT, but they didn't find anything.\n\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. And what about a PET scan of your entire body?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had one done at another hospital and it showed a hypermetabolic mass in my esophagus.\n\nDoctor: I see.

There had been five previous episodes of pleural aspiration followed by thoracocentesis. The patient was offered thoracoscopy and talc poudrage which the patient refused so an indwelling intercostal tube insertion was planned. In order not to hamper the motility a newer economical technique was employed on the lines of indwelling pleural catheter, which not only is very expensive but also not easily available in India.\nAfter detailed informed consent, the site of icd insertion site was marked by ultrasonography in the mid axillary line. The skin was thoroughly cleaned with betadine and methylated spirit. A second point was marked 5 cm behind and above the first point and lignocaine 2% was given liberally at the point of icd insertion and subcutaneously in the line between these two points. Two subcutaneous nicks were given, the first 0.5 cm behind the point of icd insertion and the second at the second point behind and a subcutaneous tunnel was created by straight artery forceps between the two points. An 18 Fr rhemsons icd tube was taken and passed through the subcutaneous tunnel and pulled out with the artery forceps. A nick was given and the front end was inserted in the chest wall as a normal icd insertion. The rear end of the tube was cut and used as an air tight cap after reversing it [].

He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography.

{"data":"A male patient aged 17 years and two months presented with a severe thoracolumbar SK. He was otherwise healthy but markedly overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 37. There was no history of spinal infections or injuries and no skeletal dysplasias. There were no associated medical co-morbidities. He had been previously followed but not treated in another spinal unit since the age of 16 years during which period his kyphosis gradually progressed and became symptomatic. On presentation in our clinic, the patient complained of persistent back pain located in the thoracolumbar junction, which affected the level of his activities. The pain did not radiate to his legs and he had no neurological symptoms.\nOn clinical examination, he had a sharply angular kyphosis of 105\u00b0 with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction, as well as bilateral hamstring tightness. Neurological examination was normal. There was an associated thoracolumbar scoliosis measuring 30\u00b0 and no evidence of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. The lateral radiograph of the spine showed bridging osteophytes anteriorly across the apex of the kyphosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed when he was initially seen at the age of 16 years and showed spinal cord attenuation across the thoracolumbar junction but no cord signal change, no disc herniation and no intraspinal anomalies. There was also no evidence of the bridging osteophytes on the MRI which indicates that these developed spontaneously in order to stabilize the spine as the kyphosis progressed further and the disc spaces collapsed anteriorly. The MRI did not report fusion of the posterior elements across the levels of the kyphosis, as well as congenital vertebral abnormalities.\nIndications for surgery included severe back pain refractory to conservative measures and modification of activities, as well as the extreme degree of deformity and risk for further progression possibly causing neurological complications.\nThe patient underwent kyphosis correction at the age of 17 years and 11 months when the deformity measured 115\u00b0 and only corrected to 100\u00b0 on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster.

My kyphosis gradually progressed and became symptomatic.\n\nDoctor: Okay, let's do a clinical examination. Can you lie down on the examination table?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nDoctor: (Examines the patient) Hmm, I see that you have a sharply angular kyphosis of 105\u00b0 with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction, as well as bilateral hamstring tightness. But your neurological examination is normal. You also have an associated thoracolumbar scoliosis measuring 30\u00b0 and there's no evidence of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis.\n\nPatient: Hmm.\n\nDoctor: We also did a lateral radiograph of your spine and it showed bridging osteophytes anteriorly across the apex of the kyphosis.\n\nPatient: What does that mean?\n\nDoctor: It means that there are bony growths in your spine that are stabilizing it.\n\nPatient: Oh, okay.\n\nDoctor: We also did a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your spine when you were initially seen at the age of 16 years and it showed spinal cord attenuation across the thoracolumbar junction but no cord signal change, no disc herniation and no intraspinal anomalies. There was also no evidence of the bridging osteophytes on the MRI which indicates that these developed spontaneously in order to stabilize the spine as the kyphosis progressed further and the disc spaces collapsed anteriorly. The MRI did not report fusion of the posterior elements across the levels of the kyphosis, as well as congenital vertebral abnormalities.\n\nPatient: Hmm.\n\nDoctor: Based on all of this, I think the indications for surgery include severe back pain that is refractory to conservative measures and modification of activities, as well as the extreme degree of deformity and the risk for further progression that could possibly cause neurological complications.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: You underwent kyphosis correction when you were 17 years and 11 months old and the deformity measured 115\u00b0. But after the surgery, it only corrected to 100\u00b0 on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster. The surgery involved a combined single-\n\nPatient: Hmm.\n\nDoctor: Do you have any questions or concerns about the surgery?\n\nPatient: No, I don't think so.\n\nDoctor: Alright, I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a few weeks. If you experience any symptoms or problems, please don't hesitate to come back.\n\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor.\n\n","idx":95004,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Persistent back pain located in the thoracolumbar junction, affecting activity level\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Severe thoracolumbar SK and persistent back pain\",\n            \"date\": \"Not specified\",\n            \"duration\": \"Not specified\",\n            \"center\": \"Not specified\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"17 years and two months\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": \"Markedly overweight\",\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"BMI of 37, no history of spinal infections, injuries, or skeletal dysplasias\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Severe back pain refractory to conservative measures, extreme degree of deformity, and risk for further progression possibly causing neurological complications\",\n            \"Type\": \"Kyphosis correction\",\n            \"time\": \"At the age of 17 years and 11 months\",\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Deformity measured 115\u00b0 and only corrected to 100\u00b0 on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster.

{"data":"Our patient was a 32-year-old gravida III para II Amhara woman who came from a rural area of North West Ethiopia. Her first delivery was an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery at home at the age of 22 years. Her second delivery was a spontaneous vaginal delivery in a health center 4 years later with early neonatal death for unknown reasons. She was seen by a health professional only once during the current pregnancy, when she experienced progressive abdominal pain 4 months prior to her delivery. She was assessed in a health center and referred to a regional hospital where she underwent an ultrasound scan and was reassured. She presented to the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital with the principal complaint of shortness of breath with associated progressive abdominal distension and pain. Her last menstrual period was unknown but she reported 9 months of amenorrhea.\nOn general examination, she looked emaciated and was slightly pale. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Her cardiovascular and respiratory system did not reveal any abnormalities. On abdominal examination her symphysis fundal height was term sized, with longitudinal lie and breech presentation. The fetal heart rate was 132 beats per minute and there were no uterine contractions. On vaginal examination the cervix was closed and uneffaced. There was no vaginal bleeding. On ultrasonography examination, there was a singleton live pregnancy with excessive amniotic fluid. The placenta appeared to be attached to the serosal surface of the fundus of her uterus and her uterus was empty. The gestational age was 40 weeks by ultrasound estimation. Her preoperative hematocrit was 34%. An emergency laparotomy was performed with the impression of abdominal pregnancy. Upon opening her abdomen and entering the peritoneum, the fetus was seen in an intact amniotic sac and there was no hemoperitoneum (Fig. ).\nOn opening the amniotic sac a live female neonate was delivered weighing 2.6kg.

{"data":"The adverse reaction to clozapine occurred in a 57-year-old married Caucasian woman with a long history of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia (ICD10 F20) who has required continuing care in hospital for many years, due to the severity of her condition. She first developed schizophrenia at around the age of 18 and has received antipsychotic medication for almost 40 years. There is a family history of schizophrenia with her son and a maternal cousin both having the condition. Despite the recognized advantages of treating many patients with schizophrenia in community settings, her symptoms - both positive and negative - have been resistant to a range of treatments and as a consequence she has been in hospital since 1985. Periodically, the patient can also exhibit challenging behaviour that requires skilled nursing support; on occasion, she has required nursing in the intensive psychiatric care unit rather than the rehabilitation ward. The patient has been prescribed many different antipsychotics over the 40 year duration of her illness, including second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication, with unfortunately no benefit to symptoms or functioning. A trial of clozapine in June 2003 was discontinued about a month later following development of acute renal failure, when she required transfer to the general hospital unit. At that time, the renal failure was attributed to clozapine by internal medicine specialists, although the patient was also taking lithium at this time, and developed secondary lithium toxicity with a peak lithium of 2.2 mmol\/L before all medication was discontinued.\nIn November 2007, after a multidisciplinary case review, it was decided that the patient might benefit from a retrial of clozapine, especially given her failure to benefit from all atypical antipsychotics available in the UK. This was considered a reasonable strategy given that the adverse renal effects seen previously when clozapine had been introduced, were thought to have been caused, or exacerbated by, lithium carbonate. Given the severe and refractory nature of the patient's condition, and taking into account the circumstances of the previous trial of clozapine, there appeared compelling grounds for a reintroduction of clozapine.

The surgery was performed without complications, and the patient reported no problems with his THAs for two years with the exception that his right leg was shorter than his left. One year after surgery, the patient had a good Harris Hip Score of 87. Two years after his bilateral THAs, the patient reports developing a draining sinus tract of his left thigh () and bilateral periprosthetic infections which were not confirmed with aspiration.

I had bilateral total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed at a different institution in 1995 using Biomet Bi-Metric stem and Ringloc cup through a posterior approach.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And what was the reason for your surgery?\nPatient: I had debilitating bilateral hip pain, and my right leg was shorter than my left.\nDoctor: I understand. And did you have any complications during the surgery?\nPatient: No, the surgery was performed without any complications.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. And how were you feeling after the surgery?\nPatient: I felt great for two years. But then I developed a draining sinus tract of my left thigh and bilateral periprosthetic infections which were not confirmed with aspiration.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And did you have a revision surgery?\nPatient: No, I didn't want to have a revision surgery and was placed on chronic antibiotics.\nDoctor: Okay. And did you have any risk factors for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any risk factors for PJI.\nDoctor: Alright. And when were you first seen in clinic again?\nPatient: I was first seen in clinic in 2004.\nDoctor: And how were you feeling at that time?\nPatient: I was doing well with no hip pain, but I had some decreased hip range of motion and heterotopic ossification around both hips on X-ray.\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any systemic symptoms?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any systemic symptoms, but I was still having some drainage from the sinus of my left thigh.\nDoctor: Alright. And what kind of antibiotics were you taking at that time?\nPatient: I was taking amoxicillin.\nDoctor: And when was your next visit?\nPatient: My next visit was in 2005.\nDoctor: And what happened during that visit?\nPatient: I had started to wean myself off my amoxicillin as there had not been any drainage from my sinus tract in several months.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And what did the doctor explain to you during that visit?\nPatient: The doctor explained to me that there were risks associated with discontinuing my antibiotics and that they had been beneficial in suppressing my hip infection to that point in time.\nDoctor: Alright. And what did you say?\nPatient: I expressed understanding and said I would continue to monitor my symptoms but was going to continue to wean myself off the antibiotics and would be sure to follow up if there were any complications.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand.

{"data":"We report the case of a 41-year-old woman with a history of presumed spinocerebellar ataxia who presented with right heart failure from an invasive mediastinal mass with near complete occlusion of her pulmonary arteries.\nShe was in her usual state of health until first presenting to the emergency department in February 2017 with bilateral lower extremity edema and progressive dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have an amorphous, invasive superior left mediastinal mass involving the main and left pulmonary arteries with occlusion of the left pulmonary arterial tree and severe narrowing of the right pulmonary artery (). At that time, she was noted to have moderate cardiomegaly with right heart enlargement and findings of elevated right heart pressures as well as several scattered, small nonspecific pulmonary nodules. Subsequent PET scan showed marked fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the anterior mediastinal mass. She underwent intravascular biopsy with interventional radiology during that first admission, and an arteriogram revealed a severely stenosed but still-patent right main pulmonary artery with no filling of the left main pulmonary artery. She was discharged with subspecialist follow-up pending biopsy results. However, initial pathology revealed only thrombus material and a minute fragment of unremarkable intima. The patient was unable to tolerate the scheduled cardiac MRI for repeat biopsy planning and was lost to follow-up until representing to thoracic surgery clinic in May 2017 after a progressive decline. At that visit, she was directly admitted for immediate further evaluation given the extent of her mass.\nOn admission in May 2017, her right heart function had declined considerably with echocardiogram notable for a severely dilated right atrium and severely dilated right ventricle with the interatrial septum bowing to the left, suggestive of right heart failure. She underwent a second biopsy via bronchoscopy; however, pathology was again nondiagnostic and notable only for fragments of fibrous tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. She then underwent a third biopsy via repeat intravascular approach that was also nondiagnostic despite seemingly adequate yield and notable only for vessel wall fragments with myxoid degeneration and few small crushed","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, I\u2019m Dr. X, and I\u2019m here to report your case.

{"data":"A 64-year-old female presented to the office with the complaint of a back mass. When asked to identify the location of the mass, she pointed to her right scapular line just below the costal margin. The patient reported that she first noticed this mass approximately one year prior to that visit. While it had not noticeably increased in size over the last year, the mass had recently started to produce dull pain.\nThe patient's past medical history was notable only for gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesterolemia, and an overweight BMI of 29.1. When prompted, she denied any history of back trauma or back surgery. During the patient's physical examination, it was difficult to identify the mass at the location she indicated. After palpation in various positions, the mass was finally identified when she was instructed to stand and flex her back forward. In this position, a mass approximately 5 cm in diameter was palpable several centimeters inferior to the point the patient had indicated. The mass was soft and mobile with a smooth border. It was not found to be reducible. Palpation did not produce any pain during this examination.\nAt the time of this office visit, it was decided that the diagnosis of lipoma was appropriate for the patient's back mass. This decision was based on her physical findings as well as an understanding of the relatively high incidence of lipoma for individuals with this patient's chief complaint. Excision of the suspected lipoma was felt to be indicated as the mass was producing discomfort and was believed to be located such that it could be accessed by a minimally invasive approach. During preoperative examination on the day of the surgery, the patient's lumbar mass was once again challenging to identify. Palpation and marking of the mass prior to the procedure could eventually be achieved by placing the patient on her left side with her legs flexed up toward her chest.

Can you tell me more about the reason for the referral?\nPatient: I've been having left side chest pain.\nDoctor: I see. And when did you first experience the chest pain?\nPatient: It's been happening for a few weeks now.\nDoctor: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms or complaints besides the chest pain?\nPatient: Yes, I have. I've been having recurrent loss of consciousness for six years, convulsions for four years, and a single episode of temporary loss of vision three years ago.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's quite a history. And are you a known hypertensive patient?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with hypertension four years ago.\nDoctor: Okay. And how has your response been to the medication for hypertension?\nPatient: It's been fair.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Do you have any known allergies or surgical history?\nPatient: No, I don't have any known allergies or surgical history.\nDoctor: Alright. And is there any history of tuberculosis contact or a known family history of epileptic disorders?\nPatient: No, there isn't.\nDoctor: Alright. And do you eat pork meat?\nPatient: Yes, I do. I eat it up to four times a week.\nDoctor: Alright. And what was your occupation before the illness?\nPatient: I was a truck driver.\nDoctor: I see. And are you married?\nPatient: Yes, I am. I have seven living children.\nDoctor: Alright. And can you tell me more about the first episode of loss of consciousness?\nPatient: It happened suddenly and lasted for a few minutes. I didn't have any prior illness.\nDoctor: Alright. And what happened after the first episode?\nPatient: I was taken to a nearby hospital where I was treated for malaria and soon resumed normal activities.\nDoctor: Alright. And what happened after the second episode of loss of consciousness?\nPatient: I woke up in a hospital two days later. During hospitalization, I was put on IV fluids and antimalarial drugs. This episode was followed by a severe headache that lasted for two days, temporarily relieved by acetaminophen tablets.\nDoctor: Alright. And what happened after the third year from the onset of the first symptom?\nPatient: I developed an episode of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions associated with tongue biting, frothing from the mouth, and neck stiffness. This was followed by loss of consciousness.\nDoctor: Alright. And have these episodes of convulsions and loss of consciousness kept recurring?\nPatient: Yes, they have. They've been happening yearly with increasing frequency and the duration of loss of consciousness in each episode.\nDoctor: Alright. And that's why you reported to our facility?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Alright. And have you noticed any skin nodules recently?\nPatient: Yes, I have. I discovered having small skin nodules in the past few months.\nDoctor: Alright. Thank you for sharing all this information with me. We'll proceed with the computed tomography angiography and see what we find. In the meantime, I would advise you to continue taking your hypertension medication as prescribed. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in a week's time to discuss the results and any necessary next steps.\nPatient: Okay, Doctor.

{"data":"The 28-year-old male patient had trained for about 2 weeks after entering a marine training center. It was said that 2-week training at the Marine training center consisted of 2\u20133 h of swimming training a day and 2 h of basic physical strength reinforcement training. The swimming training consisted of repetitions 50 min of swimming and 10 min of rest. The swimming portion consisted of swimming 25 m back and forth four times at full strength followed by swimming the same distance four times at low speeds. The trainees would then rest and begin again. The basic physical strength reinforcement training consisted of repeating walking and running for around 1 h followed by weight training to reinforce upper and lower extremity muscular strength. The degree of difficulty was no different for him than for his colleagues.\nDue to pain in the both hip joints and the left ankle he visited a private clinic, but although a simple radiological examination was performed no abnormal finding was found (Fig. a); anti-inflammatory analgesics were prescribed and immobilization was recommended. At 4 weeks after enrollment, he presented at our hospital due to the aggravation of his right hip joint symptoms, a simple radiological examination was performed on the hip areas reported to be painful, and the radiographs obtained revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture (Fig. b). A bone scan showed hot uptakes at both hips and at the left ankle joint, MRI revealed fractures of both femoral necks (the right side was displaced and complete fracture) (Fig. c). He underwent open reduction and internal fixation at right hip using cannulated screws. The region of ankle joint hot uptake by bone scan was also investigated and found to be due to a slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint and diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus on MRI. However, the patient has never made any specific complaint regarding the ankle joint. The left hip and ankle joint were treated conservatively by stabilization and long leg casting.\nHowever, reduction loss was noted 2 weeks after","conversation":"\nDoctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, but my hips and ankle have been hurting for a while now.\n\nDoctor: I see.

{"data":"A 43 year old female district nurse presented to the accident and emergency department with a 6 hour history of initially generalized abdominal pain which was localizing to the right. This was associated with nausea and loss of appetite, made worse by movement and not relieved with intramuscular morphine injection. There was no history of recent or past trauma to the chest or abdomen. On examination, she was tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding, with a Rovsing positive sign and normal bowel sounds. She was incidentally found to have some marfanoid features including the long span of upper limbs, a high arched palate and the very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient had a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome but had never undergone genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nA likely diagnosis of appendicitis was made on the clinical picture associated with a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C \u2013 reactive protein. Her abdominal X-ray at that time showed absence of gas in the right side of her bowel. Her chest X-ray did not show any obvious abnormality (Figure )\nShe was taken to theatre the same day for appendicectomy through a standard right iliac fossa incision.

I have been having abdominal pain for the past 6 hours.\nDoctor: Hmm, can you tell me more about the pain? Where is it located?\nPatient: It started off as generalized pain, but now it's localizing to the right side.\nDoctor: I see. And do you have any other symptoms besides the abdominal pain?\nPatient: Yes, I have nausea and loss of appetite. The pain gets worse when I move and the intramuscular morphine injection didn't help.\nDoctor: Okay, let's take a look. Can you lie down on the examination table for me? \nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: (Examines patient) I can feel that you're tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa. You also have rebound and guarding.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: And I noticed that you have a positive Rovsing sign. But your normal bowel sounds are a good sign.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that your appendix is likely inflamed, which could be appendicitis.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Also, I noticed that you have some marfanoid features, including the long span of your upper limbs, a high arched palate, and a very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation.\nPatient: Yes, I have a family history of Marfan's syndrome, but I've never had genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. We'll have to keep that in mind. Your blood test results showed a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C-reactive protein, which support the likely diagnosis of appendicitis.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: And your abdominal X-ray showed an absence of gas in the right side of your bowel. Your chest X-ray didn't show any obvious abnormality.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We'll need to do an appendicectomy to remove your appendix. The procedure will be done through a standard right iliac fossa incision.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: During the procedure, we found a small amount of free fluid, but the right iliac fossa was filled with a normal looking gall bladder and small bowel only. There was no sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon. The terminal ileum was found to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: We closed the right iliac fossa wound and did an exploratory laparoscopy. During the laparoscopy, we retracted the liver to see under the right liver lobe. The proximal transverse colon was found to be running up towards the liver hilum, which suggested a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that we need to do a CT thorax and abdomen to define the anatomy involved.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: After the CT scan, we'll have a better understanding of the situation and we'll be able to proceed with the next step.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor.\n\n[Conversation ends]\n\n[Patient eventually dies]\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry to inform you that your loved one has passed away.\nFamily: What happened?\nDoctor: After the CT scan, we found a herniation of the right colon into the chest, which was causing complications.

{"data":"A 60-year-old male who had a history of liver cirrhosis was referred for evaluation of a pain, swelling, and erythematous changes of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. His symptoms started a month ago without any specific trauma.

He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography.

Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in the left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The range of motion of the knee was 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion; ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees, and all of the toes had clawing deformity. As for the motor strength of the ankle, the dorsiflexion was grade 0 and plantar flexion was grade 3.

I also had a sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. Eight years later, I had a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture and had open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery.\nDoctor: I see. On your radiographs, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on your left leg. Did you experience any difficulty with your daily life functions before your symptoms appeared?\nPatient: No, except for limited motion in my ankle and toes and sensory reduction in my foot owing to the sciatic nerve injury.\nDoctor: I see. After your admission, you maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in your left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. Did you notice any changes in your ankle or toes?\nPatient: Yes, my ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees and ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees. All of my toes had clawing deformity.\nDoctor: I see. As for the motor strength of your ankle, was the dorsiflexion grade 0 and plantar flexion grade 3?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I see. And you had no sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of your foot, and had sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I see. After examination, we found that a draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. Based on our tests, we found that there was an obstruction of the popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation observed on angiography. Unfortunately, the radiographs of your left leg taken 10 years ago showed a mass that had developed over time. I'm afraid that the outlook is not very good.\nPatient's family: Is he going to be okay?\nDoctor: I'm sorry to say that your loved one has passed away.","idx":190027,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Evaluation of pain, swelling, and erythematous changes of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Evaluation of symptoms in left leg\",\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": \"Two weeks after the admission, symptoms localized and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass\",\n            \"center\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"60 years old\",\n        \"sex\": \"Male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"History of liver cirrhosis, open reduction and internal fixation for a tibial plateau fracture, sciatic nerve injury, stent insertion in the femoral artery, distal femur fracture, femoral artery rupture, obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Tibial plateau fracture\",\n            \"Type\": \"Open reduction and internal fixation\",\n            \"time\": \"18 years ago\",\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Occurred when his left knee was pinned under a tree\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"Distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture\",\n            \"Type\": \"Open reduction and internal fixation and stent insertion in the femoral artery\",\n            \"time\": \"8 years after the initial trauma\",\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Pain, swelling, erythematous changes\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": \"Anterolateral aspect of his left leg\",\n            \"time\": \"Started a month ago\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"No specific trauma associated with the onset of symptoms\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in his foot\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": \"Ankle and toes\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"Due to the sciatic nerve injury\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Fluid-filled, erythematous mass\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": \"Anterior aspect in the middle of the left leg\",\n            \"time\": \"Two weeks after admission\",\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Range of motion examination\",\n            \"result\": \"Knee flexion 0 to 100 degrees;

{"data":"RH, a 21 year old female presented to a chiropractic teaching clinic with a chief complaint of neck and thoracic spinal pain which had been present for approximately 4 years since commencing her university studies and was aggravated by studying. RH experienced this pain about once per week and it lasted for 'a couple of days'. RH had a secondary complaint of headache, which began about the same time as her primary complaint. The headaches were described as a band of pain across her forehead along with an ache at the base of her skull and in her temples. Past medical history was unremarkable save for shingles in 2004. Routine physical examination was unremarkable. Following history and examination a working diagnosis of mid-back pain of mechanical origin with associated muscle hypertonicity was established and a course of chiropractic treatments proposed. Treatment included SMT to the spinal levels thought to have restricted motion, soft-tissue treatment to the musculature of the upper back and a recommendation for core stability exercises. On a subsequent visit RH reported that she could neither lie prone on the treatment table nor could she perform even the most basic core stability exercises because to do so would result in severe abdominal pain, throat tightness and headache. Following further questioning it was determined that RH had been experiencing this triad of symptoms since she was eight years old and had subsequently avoided any activity that placed pressure on her abdomen, such as sitting close to a table when studying or performing abdominal exercises. Medical investigation for her symptoms had yielded neither a diagnosis nor a treatment. RH traced her symptoms back to a ballet class when she was age eight years during which she was required to lie prone on a wooden floor and, while holding onto her ankle, attempt to touch her toes to her head.

{"data":"A 54-year-old male presented with masses on his left arm and axilla. The axillar mass was 12 \u00d7 7 cm and the mass in the proximal lateral humerus was 6 \u00d7 5 cm. His symptoms had started a number of years prior. Before the initiation of these symptoms, he denied having any significant medical problems. He had a history of smoking for 20 years. In his family history, no relevant medical condition and\/or history of cancer was identified. He had been referred to a surgerical clinic three years prior in which he had a biopsy of the tumor reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma. It appears that he had been evaluated only for possible intestinal primaries at that time and having failed to identify the primary, had been sent to receive radiotherapy of unclear dosage. After the recurrence of his tumor, he was referred to the medical oncology department at our hospital with a mass in the left thoracic region and another in the left humerus, visible on X-rays (). His examination revealed a mass in his left breast besides the aforementioned ones. His biopsy materials were reevaluated in our pathology department and confirmed to be metastatic adenocarcinoma. The report also indicated that the mass might be breast originated, raising the suspicion towards a possible breast primary.

{"data":"A 60-year-old male who had a history of liver cirrhosis was referred for evaluation of a pain, swelling, and erythematous changes of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. His symptoms started a month ago without any specific trauma. He had a history of open reduction and internal fixation performed for a tibial plateau fracture that occurred when his left knee was pinned under a tree 18 years ago. He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography. The patient had no difficulty with his daily life functions until the aforementioned symptoms appeared, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in his foot owing to the sciatic nerve injury.\nAfter admission, the patient maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in the left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The range of motion of the knee was 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion; ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees, and all of the toes had clawing deformity. As for the motor strength of the ankle, the dorsiflexion was grade 0 and plantar flexion was grade 3.

{"data":"A 39-year-old female presented to the outpatient clinic with the complaints of recurrent painless swelling in the left thigh and had a history of surgery twice for its removal. She was apparently well until 2001 when she noticed a painless swelling over left mid-thigh. The swelling progressively increased in size and she underwent surgical excision in 2005. She remained asymptomatic for the next 2 years when she again noticed a new swelling over the left distal thigh which was excised surgically in 2009. She remained asymptomatic for the next 3 years when she had a recurrent swelling over the left distal thigh. The swelling was progressively increasing in size and was associated with some discomfort. At the time of presentation to us, she had a large, oval, around 8 cm \u00d7 4 cm size, painless swelling over the medial aspect of the left distal thigh. There was a healed scar over the left medial thigh with quadriceps wasting. The swelling was intramuscular on clinical examination. Systemic examination was unremarkable. She was further evaluated with radiographs of the thigh which was suggestive of fibrous dysplasia. This led us to go for a thorough skeletal survey, which showed the involvement of the left femur and tibia (). She was also evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of whole of the thigh which showed two additional soft tissue masses; one in left mid-thigh and the other in the left inguinal region ().

{"data":"An 80-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with a history of chronic abdominal pain and weight loss of 10 kilograms in the past six months. The patient was postmenopausal for 30 years and had a free medical history. Physical examination revealed no tenderness, but a hard and mobile mass palpable in the right iliac fossa. Further investigation by means of transvaginal ultrasound revealed a cystic formation, sized 83 \u00d7 65 \u00d7 64 mm in the right adnexal area. The mass was of mixed structure, comprising of solid and cystic areas. The wall was smooth and anechoic on ultrasound imaging. No papillary projections or septations were identified and there were no signs of blood flow during the color Doppler evaluation. The left ovary was illustrated measuring 25 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 11 mm, but the right ovary could not be visualized (Figures and ). A polyp of the endometrium was also recorded, with total endometrial thickness of 8 mm. No free fluid was seen in the Douglas pouch. However, it was inconclusive whether the mass originated from the right adnexa or it concerned a uterine necrotic leiomyoma that protruded towards the adnexa. Because of the indeterminate ultrasound findings, an abdominal CT scan was carried out which identified a cyst sized 100 \u00d7 80 mm with signs of peripheral calcification attributed to a lesion of the right ovary (Figures and ). As a routine investigation, when an ovarian tumor is suspected, our patient underwent colonoscopy, during which a benign polyp of the sigmoid colon was excised; also a submucosal round smooth cystic formation of one cm in diameter at the site of the appendix was identified. Tumor markers were within normal limits, with the exception of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA: 54, 2 ng\/mL).\nThe patient underwent laparotomy with the diagnosis of a pelvic mass, in which a cystic tumor originating from the appendix, sized 80 \u00d7 90 mm, was identified, whereas the uterus and ovaries were atrophic.

{"data":"A 39-year-old female patient was referred to our Nephrology Department during late 2009. She was newly diagnosed with SLE after a spontaneous miscarriage during the second trimester of pregnancy. Due to significant proteinuria and microscopic hematuria a kidney biopsy was performed which revealed crescentic focal segmental glomerulonephritis [class III lupus nephritis with crescents according to WHO classification ()]. She was initially managed with a combined therapeutic regimen of cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and azathioprine which was modified due to poor response, to mycophenolic acid with the addition of rituximab. However, despite the absence of extra-renal manifestations of lupus, kidney function gradually deteriorated and patient reached ESKD about 4 years after the initiation of immunosuppression. Peritoneal dialysis was the type of renal replacement therapy that was initiated with the concomitant administration of hydroxychloroquine and low dose methylprednisolone.\nShortly after the induction of peritoneal dialysis, the patient presented with fever for the first time. All possible infectious causes were investigated including peritonitis, catheter related infection and a lupus flair, nevertheless no definite diagnosis was reached, and she was managed with empiric antibiotic treatment that led to full recovery. During the next 12 months she had 3 more hospitalizations with fever as main cause of admission and all workups were inconclusive except her last admission when high CMV viral load with 157.000 copies\/mL was found. Further investigation revealed remarkably low serum immunoglobulin levels and five pulses of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. In this direction, supplementary investigation for hypoglobulinemia was performed with repetitive measurement of immunoglobulin levels after a symptom free period which confirmed earlier findings with low IgA, IgG and IgE levels but slightly elevated IgM levels (). Then on, patient had no major complications apart from two to three episodes of upper respiratory infections and acute tonsilitis each year. Evaluating both clinical course and laboratory findings the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated as acquired immunodeficiency was the most likely cause. The regimen was well tolerated.\nIn June 2020, the patient received a cadaveric kidney transplant.

They detected a small peptic perforation and repaired it with an omental patch. But then on the fourth post-operative day, I developed a burst abdomen that was managed conservatively.\nDoctor: I see, that sounds like a complicated surgery. Did your bowel eventually recover, and were you put on oral nutrition?\nPatient: Yes, my bowel got contained and I was put on oral nutrition. I was discharged and doing fine at home, but my abdominal wound was not healing.\nDoctor: In the fourth month, I can see in your clinical notes that it was covered with a split thickness skin graft. Was there any problem during the procedure or post-operative period?\nPatient: No, the procedure and post-operative period went well.

I have reviewed your physical examination, and it appears to be completely normal with no clinical signs suggestive of hypercortisolism.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that there are no obvious physical signs that indicate that you have an overproduction of cortisol.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We have also performed some studies, including an abdominal tomography, which showed a right adrenal gland nodule of 14x9 mm and another one in the left adrenal gland of 23x18 mm.

In your case, we have found an abnormal value of cortisol after a low dose suppression test with dexamethasone, which is a type of steroid hormone.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Yes, and your potassium levels were low, although you were not on diuretics. Based on these results, we have diagnosed an ACTH-independent form of hypercortisolism.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the overproduction of cortisol is not being controlled by the normal hormonal pathways.\nDoctor: The scan of your abdomen documented the presence of two adenomas, one in each adrenal gland larger than 10 mm, which presents a therapeutic challenge. The resection of one of the glands may not cure the hypercortisolism if the hormonal production is coming from both glands, and the resection of both glands would leave you with a permanent hypoadrenalism.\nPatient: What can be done about it?\nDoctor: That's why we have decided to perform an adrenal venous sampling to try to determine the origin of the cortisol production.

{"data":"A 34-year-old woman who was working as an international migrant worker sustained a crush and degloving injury to the right elbow while operating a waste agitator at an industrial waste management site. On initial examination, the patient was found to have massive skin and soft tissue defects on the anterior aspect of the elbow. The median nerve and brachial artery were exposed and contaminated (). In addition, the proximal part of the entire extensor muscle group was lost, along with segmental loss of the radial nerve with a 6-cm gap. The patient could not extend the right wrist or fingers, and severe muscle weakness (0 or 1 on manual muscle testing) was found in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. The distal area of the right arm showed signs of perfusion, albeit weaker than that in the contralateral arm. The wound was irrigated and debrided, but a bacterial infection was detected after a few days and threatened to obstruct the brachial artery further. The patient was returned to the operating room for additional debridement, a saphenous vein bypass graft to reperfuse the occluded artery and placement of a muscle flap to close the open wound using the distal part of the extensor muscles, which were not salvageable due to the proximal muscle injury and the radial nerve defect.\nThe infection resolved following those surgical procedures.

{"data":"A 66-year-old male, with a BMI of approximately 28 kg\/m2, presented to our surgery clinic for a symptomatic right lower quadrant trocar site hernia, following robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. In December of 2010 he underwent an uncomplicated robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. At the time of the operation a 12 mm trocar was placed in the right lower quadrant, and it is unclear from the operative note whether the fascia was closed at the conclusion of the operation. He recovered from the surgery without issue but unfortunately developed widely metastatic disease over the next 18 months. Upon presentation to our clinic in May of 2012, he was complaining of a two-week history of right lower quadrant pain and a newly discovered mass in the vicinity of a previous trocar site. He initially noted the onset of the pain when performing pull-ups at a local gym, at which time he noted pulling sensation in the right lower quadrant. Following the initial onset of symptoms, he continued to have pain in the area and noted an intermittent bulge as well. He presented for initial evaluation by his primary care provider who obtained a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The scan revealed a 10 mm right lower quadrant hernia with herniated fat and a tubular structure which was read as a possible omental vessel, with concern for incarceration (). Upon reviewing the CT with the patient in clinic it was felt that the tubular structure was actually the vermiform appendix and thus laparoscopic incisional hernia repair was recommended.\nHe presented the following week for an elective hernia repair. Pneumoperitoneum was established through a 12 mm umbilical Hasson port. Two additional 5 mm ports were then placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the suprapubic area.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) had shown 2 mm T inversion in V1-V3 leads, biphasic t waves in I, aVL and QT prolongation (QTc: 0.520 seconds). In the hospital coronary angiography was performed which had revealed two vessel disease. Successful percutaneous coronary intervention was done on left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) in the same session (). The patient was discharged home the next day. She was doing well for about a month till 2 days prior to her second admission when presented with multiple episodes of angina on exertion. She was admitted again. Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits and there were no new ECG changes. Echocardiography showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% without any resting wall motion abnormalities. She still complained of occasional angina pain until she developed a severe resting chest pain associated with nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis at the second day of admission.

How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, thank you.\n\nDoctor: Can you tell me what happened? Why did you come to see me today?\n\nPatient: I was admitted to the hospital with typical angina and impression of acute coronary syndrome.\n\nDoctor: I see. Do you have a history of hypertension?\n\nPatient: Yes, I do.\n\nDoctor: Alright. I see that you had an electrocardiogram (ECG) done in the past. Can you tell me what the results showed?\n\nPatient: Yes, the ECG showed 2 mm T inversion in V1-V3 leads, biphasic t waves in I, aVL and QT prolongation.\n\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And what happened during your hospital admission?\n\nPatient: They performed a coronary angiography and found two vessel disease. They did a successful percutaneous coronary intervention on my left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) in the same session. I was discharged home the next day.\n\nDoctor: That's good to hear. And what happened after you were discharged?\n\nPatient: I was doing well for about a month until 2 days prior to my second admission when I presented with multiple episodes of angina on exertion.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what happened during your second admission?\n\nPatient: Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits and there were no new ECG changes. Echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% without any resting wall motion abnormalities. I still complained of occasional angina pain until I developed a severe resting chest pain associated with nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis at the second day of admission.\n\nDoctor: That sounds very painful. And what happened then?\n\nPatient: There was dynamic ECG changed associated with a rise in cardiac biomarkers. I was transferred to your center for urgent coronary angiography.\n\nDoctor: I see. And when you arrived at our emergency department, what was your pain score?\n\nPatient: My angina had already decreased to 3 out of a 10 scale pain score.\n\nDoctor: That's good to hear. And what did the electrocardiogram show when you arrived here?\n\nPatient: It showed ST depression in V2-V5 leads.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what happened during the catheterization?\n\nPatient: The problem was observed just before contrast injection. There was a foreign body material stuck in the left main coronary artery, which was the tip of a guiding catheter.\n\nDoctor: I see.

And what was done to treat it?\n\nPatient: I was sent immediately to the operating room and coronary artery bypass grafting was done successfully.\n\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

These acts of regurgitation were frequently observed by friends and family. When she presented to our care, she was very malnourished and had been maintained on nocturnal jejunal tube feedings.

Due to the repercussions of her illness, she avoided social gatherings and was not able to maintain her job due to these frequent episodes of regurgitation and subsequent vomiting or swallowing of the food.\nHer past medical problems included asthma and anxiety. Since the beginning of her symptoms 4 years ago she was misdiagnosed multiple times with other gastrointestinal disorders.

{"data":"The patient was a 47-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who presented to our institution with dysphagia and neck pain after multiple previous cervical spine surgeries at an outside hospital. Her history began with an ACDF from C5 to C7 in 2009 for neck and arm pain. Following her index procedure, she experienced nonunion with loosening of screws and thus underwent a revision extension ACDF from C3 to C7 in 2010 which resulted in significant and immediate neck and arm pain relief. Despite her pain relief, her postoperative course was complicated by superficial surgical site infection necessitating irrigation and debridement 3 days later and antibiotics. Despite no apparent intraoperative complications or oropharyngeal perforation, she experienced significant dysphagia following the third surgery, and, despite unremarkable serial esophagrams, required a feeding tube for approximately 1 year. Gradually, after this period of oropharyngeal rest, her dysphagia somewhat improved and she was able to tolerate a mechanical soft diet with some difficulty. The patient had sustained pain relief but persistent dysphagia for approximately 3 years without any additional work-up. The patient initially presented to our institution following a low-energy fall. Her symptomatology had not changed but routine cervical spine imaging was obtained and she was subsequently referred to our spine specialty clinic for continued evaluation.\nAt the time of her presentation, her plain film radiography () and computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine () revealed nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis with local kyphosis, screw loosening, plate migration, and air communicating with the plate raising concern for esophageal perforation. In the context of her persistent dysphagia, mild pain, and imaging findings, it was deemed reasonable to proceed with neck exploration in conjunction with our otolaryngology colleagues with plans to remove hardware and then perform staged revision extension of previous fusion from a posterior approach.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and direct laryngoscopy was performed. A pharyngeal defect with exposure of the spinal hardware was noted in the posterior pharynx in the midline (). Further evaluation beyond the proximal esophagus was not attempted","conversation":"\nDoctor: Good morning, what brings you to the hospital today?\n\nPatient: I have been experiencing some neck pain and dysphagia.\n\nDoctor: I see.

{"data":"A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures \u2013). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 \u00d7 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5\/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3\/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed","conversation":"Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm not feeling too good, doctor. I have some complaints about a persistent orocutaneous fistula.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your medical history?\nPatient: Sure. I had a plasmacytoma removed from the medial side of my left mandible 3 years ago.\nDoctor: Okay. And were you referred to our clinic for this issue?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I see. CT images have demonstrated that there is a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. None of the previous operations were successful in closing the fistula.\nPatient: Yes, that's right. \nDoctor: The main reason for this is believed to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, we have decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nPatient: Okay, what does that mean exactly?\nDoctor: Under general anesthesia, we will excise the fistula initially and prepare the healthy soft tissues. At the extraoral site, we will extend the incision to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, we will dissect the superficial layer of the neck fascia to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible will be exposed, and the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland will be dissected. The gland will then be mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. \nPatient: Okay, I understand.\nDoctor: Then, at the oral site, the margins of the wound will be released by blunt dissection and will be closed by mattress sutures via 5\/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel will be prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area, and the submandibular gland will be rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle. The rotated gland will be sutured to the recipient site with 3\/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap will be closed.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds like a lot.\nDoctor: It is a complex procedure, but we believe it will be effective in closing the fistula. After the procedure, we will give you instructions on follow-up care.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful outcome for you.","idx":174017,"summary":"{\n    \"visit motivation\": \"Complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula\",\n    \"admission\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": None,\n            \"date\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"center\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"patient information\": {\n        \"age\": \"56\",\n        \"sex\": \"male\",\n        \"ethnicity\": None,\n        \"weight\": None,\n        \"height\": None,\n        \"family medical history\": None,\n        \"recent travels\": None,\n        \"socio economic context\": None,\n        \"occupation\": None\n    },\n    \"patient medical history\": {\n        \"physiological context\": \"Plasmacytoma enucleated from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago\",\n        \"psychological context\": None,\n        \"vaccination history\": None,\n        \"allergies\": None,\n        \"exercise frequency\": None,\n        \"nutrition\": None,\n        \"sexual history\": None,\n        \"alcohol consumption\": None,\n        \"drug usage\": None,\n        \"smoking status\": None\n    },\n    \"surgeries\": [\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"To close the orocutaneous fistula\",\n            \"Type\": \"Local flaps\",\n            \"time\": \"Operated three times in the past\",\n            \"outcome\": \"None of these operations were successful\",\n            \"details\": \"The main reason for the failure was considered to be ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reason\": \"To fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps using the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap\",\n            \"Type\": \"Excision of the fistula and preparation of oral and cutaneous healthy soft tissues; mobilization of the submandibular gland; suturing of the gland to the recipient site\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"outcome\": None,\n            \"details\": \"The submandibular gland was used to fill the defect after mobilization, and the oral and cutaneous sites were prepared and sutured\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"symptoms\": [\n        {\n            \"name of symptom\": \"Persistent orocutaneous fistula\",\n            \"intensity of symptom\": None,\n            \"location\": \"Medial side of the left mandible\",\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"temporalisation\": None,\n            \"behaviours affecting the symptom\": None,\n            \"details\": \"The patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"medical examinations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"CT images\",\n            \"result\": \"The medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 \u00d7 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland.\",\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"diagnosis tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": None,\n            \"severity\": None,\n            \"result\": None,\n            \"condition\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"details\": None\n        }\n    ],\n    \"treatments\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Use of the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap\",\n            \"related condition\": \"Persistent orocutaneous fistula\",\n            \"dosage\": None,\n            \"time\": None,\n            \"frequency\": None,\n            \"duration\": None,\n            \"reason for taking\": \"To fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps\",\n            \"reaction to treatment\": None,\n            \"details\": \"The fistula was excised, and the submandibular gland was mobilized and rotated to fill the defect, then sutured to the recipient site.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"discharge\": {\n        \"reason\": None,\n        \"referral\": None,\n        \"follow up\": None,\n        \"discharge summary\": None\n    }\n}"}

{"data":"We present a case of a 42-year-old female who was found to have an incidental renal mass, which, on histological examination of the excised specimen, was revealed to be a clear cell papillary carcinoma, a relatively uncommon variant of renal cell carcinoma. The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented to her local medical officer with a two-week history of neck pain and radicular like pains extending into her right arm. A CT scan of her cervical spine revealed multilevel intervertebral disc and facet joint degenerative change resulting in neural exit foraminal narrowing. She was noted to have raised inflammatory markers (WCC 27.5, neutrophils 24.8, and CRP 319) and S. aureus was isolated on a blood culture. She was commenced on IV antibiotics; however her symptoms failed to improve and she subsequently developed significant lower back pain for which a CT of her lumbar spine was arranged. This revealed no convincing evidence of a lumbar spine infective process; however a 47 \u00d7 31 mm solid upper pole mass with an irregular periphery and internal calcification was identified in the left kidney, suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma.\nThe renal mass was further characterized with a triple phase abdominal CT scan and this confirmed a 4 \u00d7 4.9 \u00d7 4.5 cm heterogenous mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of left renal vein involvement nor was any radiologically significant lymphadenopathy seen. Her films were reviewed and the decision was made to biopsy the left renal mass to establish whether the lesion was neoplastic or inflammatory. A core biopsy of the left kidney was reported as a Fuhrman grade 1, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (). She was then booked for an elective laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy. She underwent this procedure without complication and had an uneventful postoperative course subsequently being discharged home on day four.\nMacroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a tumor in the mid portion of the kidney located superior to the renal hilum measuring 48 mm \u00d7 40 mm \u00d7 46 mm","conversation":"Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Not too good.

{"data":"A 70-year-old female was referred to breast re-implantation of the right side due to iatrogenic rupture and explantation during thoracic surgery. The patient had a medical history of cancer in the right breast in 1984 with subsequent treatment including unilateral mastectomy, radiochemotherapy and secondary reconstruction with a subpectoral silicone implant. In 2015 the patient was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in the right thigh and bilateral pulmonary metastases. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection of the right lung and during this procedure iatrogenic perforation of the silicone implant and injury to the thoracic wall occurred. The thoracic cavity was closed and the perforated breast implant removed without diagnosis of the defect.\nIn stabile condition, the patient expressed a strong desire for breast re-implantation and during this procedure the defect of the thoracic wall and parietal pleura was observed. As the defect was minor, simple closure of soft tissue over the defect would be appropriate in patients not planned for breast reconstruction, however the patient in this case had expressed an extremely strong desire for breast reconstruction. In case of direct closure communication would persist between the lung and the capsular space and therefore it was necessary to close the defect with a thin layer of material allowing both secure closure of the defect and re-implantation. The highly vascularised capsule is known to be appropriate for creation of flaps and grafts, and has previously been used in management of issues in relation to breast implants []. The capsule tissue was an appropriate choice for creation of a pedicled flap in this case because the tissue presented a minimally invasive treatment option for the patient compared to closure with a muscle flap or addition of non-autologus tissue such ADM, increasing infection risk. The anterior part of the capsule in relation to the pectoral muscle was dissected free from the upper pole to the inframammary fold resulting in a medially and centrally vascularised flap. The flap was rotated with the agglutinating side facing downwards to cover the pleural defect and sutured shut. The","conversation":"Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, thank you.\nDoctor: I understand you were referred to us for re-implantation of your right breast. Can you tell me a little bit about your history?\nPatient: Yes, I had a rupture and explantation during thoracic surgery.\nDoctor: I see. And do you have a history of cancer?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with cancer in my right breast in 1984 and I had a mastectomy and radiochemotherapy as treatment. I also had a secondary reconstruction with a silicone implant.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. And in 2015, you were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma and bilateral pulmonary metastases, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And you underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had a VATS wedge resection of my right lung.\nDoctor: And during that procedure, there was a perforation of your silicone implant and injury to your thoracic wall, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I see. And the perforated breast implant was removed without a diagnosis of the defect, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I understand you are in a stable condition and you have expressed a strong desire for breast re-implantation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Okay. During the procedure, we observed a minor defect in your thoracic wall and parietal pleura. In most cases, simple closure of soft tissue over the defect would be appropriate, but since you have expressed an extremely strong desire for breast reconstruction, we needed to use a different approach.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We closed the defect with a thin layer of material that allowed secure closure of the defect and re-implantation. The highly vascularized capsule tissue was an appropriate choice for creation of a pedicled flap. This was a minimally invasive treatment option for you compared to closure with a muscle flap or addition of non-autologus tissue, which would have increased the risk of infection.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: The anterior part of the capsule in relation to the pectoral muscle was dissected free and the flap was rotated and sutured shut.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: Is there anything you would like to ask or anything that is unclear to you?\nPatient: No, I think you explained everything clearly. Thank you.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Just to summarize, we performed a re-implantation of your right breast after a minor defect was observed in your thoracic wall and parietal pleura. The highly vascularized capsule tissue was used to create a pedicled flap and the anterior part of the capsule was dissected and sutured shut.\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Great. I would like to see you back in two weeks for a follow-up appointment. Is that okay with you?\nPatient: Yes, that's fine.\nDoctor: Great.

He underwent a transurethral resection and the pathology was low grade Ta. His first surveillance cystoscopy was negative. In October 2016 he had four LG Ta tumors which were resected. This was followed by 6 weeks of intravesical chemotherapy using mitomycin C.\nThe patient was tumor free until August 2018 at which time he was found to have multifocal bladder cancer.
