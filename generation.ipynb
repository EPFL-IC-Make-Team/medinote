      "This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea.\n",
      "We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward.\n",
      "First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.\n",
      "To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step.\n",
      "In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes.\n",
      "This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.\n",
      "Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.\n",
      "Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution.\n",
      "In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity.\n",
      "However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.\n",

      "Patient: Yes, that's right. It took about 30 minutes to change to the prone position.\n",

      "This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea.\n",
      "We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward.\n",
      "First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.\n",
      "To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step.\n",
      "In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes.\n",
      "This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.\n",
      "Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.\n",
      "Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution.\n",
      "In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity.\n",
      "However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.\n",
      "Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.\n",

      "The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities.\n",
      "In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises.\n",
      "However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa.\n",
      "The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet.\n",
      "To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea.\n",
      "He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises.\n",
      "Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence.\n",

      "This 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, heavy dry cough, and fever 6 days after testing positive for COVID-19.\n",
      "Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning.\n",
      "The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy.\n",
      "Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern).\n",
      "When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques.\n",
      "The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse.\n",
      "To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow.\n",
      "After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough.\n",
      "He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning.\n",
      "To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night.\n",
      "Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization.\n",

      "A 66-year-old male started to present symptoms of fever, dyspnea, coughing, asthenia, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.\n",
      "He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS.\n",
      "After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair.\n",
      "However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O].\n",
      "Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes ().\n",
      "The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles.\n",
      "This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.\n",

      "Following the acute phase, with intermittent proning, the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable and was difficult to wean.\n",
      "Rehabilitation proved challenging under these conditions, and physical therapists had to reevaluate and adapt their interventions daily according to his condition.\n",
      "After 2 weeks, he was tracheotomized and started to improve very slowly.\n",
      "One week after tracheostomy, the patient was able to speak for the first time after a cuff-down trial and with the help of a speaking valve.\n",
      "But the patient spoke only a few words with us and it was often difficult to involve him in exercises.\n",
      "Two days later, he was able to communicate with his relatives via video telephony.\n",
      "This was a very emotional moment for everyone involved, but it improved his communication and he was able to express to his wife that he had no strength left to continue.\n",
      "However, through the family’s active participation in his early rehabilitation process, they were able to reinforce his confidence and motivation.\n",
      "He was discharged to a rehabilitation clinic severely weak (MRC-SS 40/60) and functionally impaired (CPAx 22/50), but continued to progress in slow steps.\n",
