      "First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.\n",
      "To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step.\n",
      "In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes.\n",
      "This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.\n",
      "Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.\n",
      "Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution.\n",
      "In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity.\n",
      "However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.\n",

      "Patient: Yes, that's right. It took about 30 minutes to change to the prone position.\n",

      "This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea.\n",
      "We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward.\n",
      "First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.\n",
      "To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step.\n",
      "In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes.\n",
      "This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.\n",
      "Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.\n",
      "Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution.\n",
      "In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity.\n",
      "However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.\n",
      "Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.\n",

      "A 39-year-old man was hospitalized due to an increasingly reduced general health condition, after persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks.\n",
      "The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities.\n",
      "In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises.\n",
      "However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa.\n",
      "The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet.\n",
      "To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea.\n",
      "He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises.\n",
      "Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence.\n",
      "Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.\n",

      "This 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, heavy dry cough, and fever 6 days after testing positive for COVID-19.\n",
      "Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning.\n",
      "The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy.\n",
      "Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern).\n",
      "When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques.\n",
      "The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse.\n",
      "To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow.\n",
      "After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough.\n",
      "He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning.\n",
      "To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night.\n",
      "Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization.\n",
      "At the time of writing, the patient was still in the ICU without ventilatory support.\n",

      "Paramedics found this 59-year-old female with dyspnea and an oxygenation of 65% on room air and performed immediate tracheal intubation.\n",
      "Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.\n",
      "On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation.\n",
      "SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state.\n",
      "The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists.\n",
      "Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions.\n",
      "She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists.\n",
      "She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia.\n",
      "The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation.\n",
      "On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen).\n",
      "After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12).\n",

      "He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS.\n",
      "After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair.\n",
      "However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O].\n",
      "Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes ().\n",
      "The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles.\n",
      "This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.\n",

      "The patient was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of liver cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, tobacco use, and post-stent coronary artery disease, who initially came to the hospital for elective left and right heart catheterization as a pre-transplant evaluation.\n",
      "Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins.\n",
      "A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately.\n",
      "The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction.\n",
      "Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found.\n",
      "Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient’s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation.\n",
      "Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient’s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.\n",
      "Right internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure.\n",
      "A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium.\n",
      "Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).\n",
      "A Glidewire advantage was advanced through the right femoral vein but was unable to cross the 100% occluded IVC.\n",
      "Then, a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter was tried and was successfully advanced through the IVC all the way to the right atrium.\n",
