       "'“Z,” a 14-year-old girl, was referred to our child psychiatry clinic because she was experiencing a mania episode. Both a magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalography revealed no hint of an organic cause of her manic symptoms. Since her history also revealed a depressive episode, she was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder type 1 using the Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version. Then, the Young Mania Rating Scale was used to measure the severity of her manic symptoms; her score was 45.\\nWe started treatment with SV 250 mg/day for the first 4 days. We also administered risperidone 1 mg/day to resolve the ideas of reference symptom throughout the course of treatment. At the 15th day, the dose of SV was titrated to 750 mg/day (250 mg at noon and 500 mg at night). Since the SV dose reached 750mg/day Z began bedwetting. About 4 weeks later, when the dose of SV was titrated up to 500mg twice a day (a blood level of 75μg/ml), Z developed diurnal and nocturnal enuresis every day at the fifth week, she even had urinary incontinence in the classroom at school.\\nZ had not taken SV before, and her personal history revealed that she achieved urinary bladder control at 4 years old; since then, she had had no urinary incontinence. The family history was negative for enuresis, and urological and neurological evaluations were normal. Because of the enuresis, the SV dose was reduced to 500 mg/day (a blood level of 38.3 μg/mL), and her bedwetting disappeared completely 2 days later. At her follow-up visit half a year later, she appeared to be well adjusted to the treatment, which consisted of SV at 500 mg/night and risperidone 1 mg/day.'"

      "We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward.\n",
      "First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.\n",
      "To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step.\n",
      "In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes.\n",
      "This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.\n",
      "Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.\n",
      "Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution.\n",
      "In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity.\n",
      "However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.\n",

      "This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction.\n",
      "These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine.\n",

      "After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 × 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it.\n",
      "The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers.\n",
      "On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm ().\n",

      "The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain.\n",
      "She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it ().\n",
      "The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor.\n",
      "Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously.\n",
      "The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender.\n",
      "Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor.\n",
      "At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable.\n",
      "The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared ().\n",
      "From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed.\n",
      "Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum.\n",
      "The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears ().\n",
      "Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss.\n",
      "Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition [].\n",
      "However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4.\n",
      "Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A [], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7.\n",
      "Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas.\n",
      "The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination ().\n",

      "He was otherwise well, though was currently unable to perform any activities that involved prolonged weight bearing and found it increasingly difficult to continue his occupation within allied health care.\n",
      "The patient noted an initial diagnosis of OCD at age 13.\n",
      "This was appropriately treated conservatively with a period of reduced load and protected weight bearing.\n",
      "He was later able to return to sport - which included Australian Rules football.\n",
      "Due to recurrence of pain he underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14.\n",
      "Arthroscopic probing of the OCD lesion indicated that it was stable and conservative management and further unloading was pursued.\n",
      "The patient failed conservative management and 1 year later underwent a repeat arthroscopy at which time an unstable 3 cm × 3 cm lesion involving his medial femoral condyle was removed.\n",
      "It was felt that as the fragment had little subchondral bone that direct repair was not achievable.\n",
      "A further arthroscopy was performed 8 months later and a chondral biopsy was taken for later autologous chondrocyte transplantation.\n",
      "At the time it was noted that no healing had occurred at the site of the defect.\n",
      "Two months later, the treating surgeon, using a lateral arthrotomy approach, patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI).\n",
      "The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue.\n",
      "One year later, and due to persistent discomfort and swelling of the knee, the patient underwent a further arthroscopy.\n",
      "It was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, yet an inner area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm had failed to fill completely.\n",
      "At age 23 and due to troubling discomfort and mechanical features of instability the patient underwent another arthroscopy.\n",
      "Numerous loose bodies within both the medial and lateral compartments were washed out.\n",

      "The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic.\n",
      "In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history.\n",
      "Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region.\n",

      "He did not recall any inciting factors.\n",
      "He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977.\n",
      "Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred.\n",
      "On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle.\n",

      "Her mother had end-stage breast cancer.\n",
      "We visited her house regularly to care for her mother.\n",
      "The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired.\n",
      "There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\n",
      "When we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD.\n",
      "However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members.\n",
      "According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care.\n",
      "They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition.\n",
      "She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not.\n",
      "She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them.\n",
      "Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder.\n",
      "We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer.\n",
      "The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\n",
      "After a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood.\n",

      "On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle.\n",

      "He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977.\n",
      "Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred.\n",
      "On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle.\n",

      "A 40-year-old dominant right-handed male working in private insurance company with no significant medical history suffered a distal radius fracture of the left hand due to road traffic accident ().\n",
      "On clinical examination, he could move the fingers of the hand and there was no evidence of any neurovascular deficit distal to the injury.\n",
      "Crepitus could be felt in the distal part of the radius just proximal to wrist joint and movements around the wrist were painful and limited.\n",
      "There were no other associated injuries, and medical history was not significant for any medical illness.\n",
      "A clinical diagnosis of the fracture of lower end radius was made and radiographs were consistent with the clinical diagnosis.\n",

      "We could not identify the absence of the FCR tendon preoperatively because of severe swelling of the distal forearm.\n",
      "The incision was made at its usual location and we identified one tendon in the superficial plane which we thought was FCR, but when we traced the tendon proximally it started thinning without any muscle belly and when traced distally to its attachment, it was confirmed to be tendon of palmaris longus (PL).\n",
      "We could not find any tendon between PL and the traced radial artery.\n",
      "At that stage, we realized that FCRL was absent in that patient.\n",
      "We wrongly identified the PL tendon as the FCR because it was the tendinous structure at the most radial location of the volar distal forearm.\n",
      "When we found the median nerve just radial to the PL tendon, we were then able to identify the anatomical abnormality described in this case and immediate post-operative X-ray (-).\n",

      "The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities.\n",
      "Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.\n",

      "Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\n",
      "In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed.\n",

      "The pacing leads and box were removed and the infection was treated with antibiotics.\n",
      "Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, transvenous approach for implantation of a new pacing system proved not to be feasible.\n",

      "The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle.\n",
      "Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise.\n",
      "The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall.\n",
      "It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle.\n",
      "The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested.\n",
      "A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle.\n",

      "The patient is a 58-year old male who was being evaluated for inguinal hernia repair.\n",
      "His past medical history included CAD with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery, diabetes with a HbA1c of 5.7 and an 80-pack year smoking history.\n",
      "He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea.\n",
      "In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates.\n",
      "He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery.\n",
      "This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery ().\n",
      "This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis.\n",
      "With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD ().\n",
      "Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\n",
      "He was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months.\n",
      "A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis.\n",
      "Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG.\n",
      "The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\n",
      "The patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively.\n",
      "He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day.\n",
      "After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft.\n",
      "The greater saphenous vein was harvested endoscopically.\n",
      "After this was performed, a midline laparotomy was performed, extending the sternotomy incision.\n",

      "An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago.\n",
      "Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed at a local hospital a few days before visiting our hospital because the headache worsened and was not relieved through medication.\n",
      "Initial brain CT revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity ().\n",
      "Few calcified nodules were noted at the left frontotemporal cortex.\n",
      "However, it was initially considered a simple traumatic hemorrhage and was managed by conservative means.\n",
      "Several days later, the headache aggravated and the patient experienced an episode of generalized partial seizure.\n",
      "On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed immediately after the seizure, the size of acute hematoma and cerebral edema was markedly increased, and a small enhancing mass was observed at the left cerebral convexity ().\n",
      "Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region ().\n",
      "Emergency craniotomy was performed to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma.\n",
      "A large craniotomy was done, and the subdural hematoma was removed by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision.\n",
      "While further opening of the dura, we were encountered by several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules which were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain ().\n",
      "Upon careful dissection, these nodules were noted to be buried in the sulcus while being severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries.\n",
      "Between the nodules was an organizing hematoma and upon careful removal, a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch was exposed.\n",
      "The involved MCA branch was carefully dissected and was trapped by clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm.\n",
      "The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised.\n",
      "The ischemic injury was minimized because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery.\n",

      "An 82-year-old male presented with a large right IIA aneurysm diagnosed during routine surveillance on a long background history of complicated aortoiliac endovascular intervention.\n",
      "His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.\n",
      "He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n",
      "This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms.\n",
      "In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft.\n",
      "Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms.\n",
      "A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm.\n",
      "The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system.\n",
      "Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum.\n",
      "It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible.\n",
      "The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().\n",
      "The decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation.\n",
      "Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery.\n",
      "The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch.\n",

      "At that time, a tortuous basilar artery had been found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation ().\n",
      "She had undergone endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital ().\n",
      "However, she developed severe headache seven months after the treatment.\n",
      "At the time of admission, she complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area.\n",
      "Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities.\n",
      "On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem ().\n",

      "To relieve the brain stem compression, we decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention.\n",
      "In advance of performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft.\n",
      "This is because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since the patient had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA.\n",
